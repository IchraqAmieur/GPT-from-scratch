I should've known that you would be
here, Professor McGonagall.
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.
Are the rumors true, Albus?
I'm afraid so, professor. The good and
the bad.
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.
Is it wise to trust Hagrid with
something so important?
Professor, I would trust Hagrid with
my life.
Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor
McGonagall.
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.
Little tyke fell asleep as we were
flying over Bristol.
Try not to wake him.
There you go.
Do you really think it's safe, leaving
him with these people?
I've watched them all day. They're the
worst sort of Muggles.
- They really are-
- The only family he has.
He'll be famous. Every child in our
world will know his name.
Exactly.
He's far better off growing up away
from all of that.
Until he's ready.
There, there, Hagrid. It's not really
goodbye, after all.
Good luck...
...Harry Potter.
Up. Get up!
Now!
Wake up, cousin! We're going to the
zoo!
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.
Cook breakfast. And try not to burn
anything.
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...
...for my Dudley's special day!
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.
Aren't they wonderful, darling?
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.
36?! But last year I had 37!
- But some are bigger than last
year's.
- I don't care!
This is what we're going to do.
We're going to buy you two new
presents. How's that, pumpkin?
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.
I'm warning you now, boy.
Any funny business, any at all...
...and you won't have any meals for a
week.
Get in.
Make it move.
Move!
- Move!
- He's asleep!
He's boring.
Sorry about him.
He doesn't understand what it's like,
lying there...
...watching people press their ugly
faces in on you.
Can you hear me?
It's just, I've never talked to a
snake before.
Do you...?
Do you talk to people often?
You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it
nice there?
Do you miss your family?
I see. That's me as well. I never knew
my parents either.
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe what
this snake is doing!
Thanks.
Anytime.
Snake!
Mum! Mummy! Help me!
My darling boy! How did you get in
there?
Who did this? How did you get in
there? Is there a snake?
It's all right, sweetheart. We'll get
you out of these cold clothes.
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!
The glass was there and then it was
gone, like magic.
There's no such thing as magic.
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
No more mail through this letterbox.
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
Shoo! Go on.
Fine day, Sunday.
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!
No post on Sunday.
No blasted letters today! No, sir.
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--
Make it stop, please!
Stop it!
Mummy, what's happening?
Give me that! Give me that letter!
Get off!
They're my letters! Let go of me!
That's it! We're going away!
Far away, where they can't find us!
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
Make a wish, Harry.
Who's there?
Sorry about that.
I demand that you leave at once. You
are breaking and entering.
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.
I haven't seen you since you was a
baby, Harry.
You're a bit more along than I
expected. Particularly in the middle.
I'm not Harry.
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.
Got something for you.
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.
Baked it myself, words and all.
Thank you.
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?
Excuse me, but who are you?
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts.
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.
Didn't you ever wonder where your mum
and dad learned it all?
Learned what?
You're a wizard, Harry.
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.
A good one, I'd wager, once you're
trained up.
No, you've made a mistake. I mean...
...I can't be a wizard.
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.
Well, Just Harry, did you ever make
anything happen?
Anything you couldn't explain, when
you were angry or scared?
"Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to
accept you...
...at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry."
He will not be going! We swore we'd
put a stop to all this rubbish.
You knew? You knew all along and you
never told me?
Of course we knew. How could you not
be?
My perfect sister being who she was.
My mother and father were so proud the
day she got her letter.
"We have a witch in the family. Isn't
it wonderful?"
I was the only one to see her for what
she was.
A freak!
Then she met that Potter, and then she
had you...
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.
And then she got herself blown up, and
we got landed with you.
Blown up? You told me my parents died
in a car crash.
A car crash? A car crash killed Lily
and James Potter?
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!
He'll not be going.
A great Muggle like you is going to
stop him?
Muggle?
Non-magic folk. This boy's had his
name down since he were born.
He's going to the finest school of
witchcraft and wizardry.
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.
I will not pay to have a crackpot old
fool teach him magic tricks.
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...
...in front of me.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.
We're a bit behind schedule. Best be
off.
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.
"All students must be equipped with...
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."
Can we find all this in London?
If you know where to go.
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
No, thanks, Tom. I'm on official
Hogwarts business.
Just helping Harry buy his school
supplies.
Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter!
Welcome back, Mr. Potter. Welcome
back.
Doris Crockford. I can't believe I'm
meeting you at last.
Harry Potter. Can't tell you how
pleased I am to meet you.
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Fearfully fascinating subject.
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?
Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to
buy.
Goodbye.
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?
All those people, how is it they know
who I am?
I'm not sure I'm the right person to
tell you that.
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.
Here, you get your quills and ink.
Over there, all your bits and bobs for
doing wizardry.
It's a world-class racing broom.
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!
It's the fastest model yet.
But how am I to pay for all this? I
haven't any money.
There's your money. Gringotts, the
wizard bank.
Ain't no safer place, not one. Except
perhaps Hogwarts.
Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.
Best stay close.
Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a
withdrawal.
And does Mr. Harry Potter have his
key?
Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere.
Ha! There's the little devil.
And there's something else as well.
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.
It's about You-Know-What in vault
you-know-which.
Very well.
Vault 687.
Lamp, please.
Key, please.
Did you think your parents would leave
you with nothing?
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?
Can't tell you. Hogwarts business.
Very secret.
Stand back.
Best not to mention this to anyone.
I still need a wand.
A wand? You want Ollivanders. There
ain't no place better.
Run along there and wait. I got one
more thing to do. Won't be long.
Hello?
Hello?
I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr.
Potter.
It seems only yesterday...
...that your mother and father were in
here buying their first wands.
Here we are.
Give it a wave.
Apparently not.
Perhaps...
...this.
No, no, definitely not. No matter.
I wonder....
Curious.
Very curious.
Sorry, but what's curious?
I remember every wand I've ever sold,
Mr. Potter.
It so happens that the phoenix...
...whose tail feather resides in your
wand, gave another feather.
Just one other.
It is curious that you should be
destined for this wand...
...when its brother gave you that
scar.
And who owned that wand?
We do not speak his name.
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr.
Potter.
It's not always clear why.
But I think it is clear...
...that we can expect great things
from you.
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...
...did great things.
Terrible...
...yes, but great.
Harry! Harry!
Happy birthday.
You all right, Harry? You seem very
quiet.
He killed my parents, didn't he? The
one who gave me this.
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.
First, and understand this because
it's very important:
Not all wizards are good.
Some of them go bad. A few years
ago...
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--
- His name was V--
- Maybe if you wrote it down?
No, I can't spell it.
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?
It was dark times, Harry.
Voldemort started to gather some
followers.
Brought them over to the Dark Side.
Anyone that stood up to him ended up
dead.
Your parents fought against him.
But nobody lived once he decided to
kill them.
Nobody, not one.
Except you.
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on
your forehead, Harry.
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.
What happened to V--? To You-Know-Who?
Well, some say he died.
Codswallop, in my opinion.
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...
...too tired to carry on.
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.
That's why you're famous. That's why
everybody knows your name.
You're the boy who lived.
What are you looking at?
Blimey, is that the time?
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--
Well, he'll be wanting to see me. Your
train leaves in 10 minutes.
Here's your ticket. Stick to your
ticket, that's very important.
"Platform 9 3/4"?
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.
There's no such thing, is there?
Sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
On your left.
Can you tell me where I might find
platform 9 3/4?
Think you're being funny, do you?
It's the same every year, packed with
Muggles.
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.
All right, Percy, you first.
Fred, you next.
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?
I'm sorry, George.
I'm only joking. I am Fred.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me how to...?
How to get onto the platform? Not to
worry, dear.
It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as
well.
All you do is walk straight at the
wall between platforms 9 and 10.
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.
Excuse me. Do you mind? Everywhere
else is full.
Not at all.
I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
So it's true!
I mean, do you really have the...?
- The what?
- The scar?
Wicked!
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.
We'll take the lot.
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.
There's chocolate and peppermint and
also...
...spinach, liver and tripe.
George sweared he got a
booger-flavored one once.
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.
Each pack's got a famous witch or
wizard. I've got about 500 meself.
Watch it!
That's rotten luck. They've only got
one good jump in them.
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.
Hey, he's gone!
You can't expect him to hang around
all day, can you?
This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he?
A little.
Fred gave me a spell to turn him
yellow. Want to see?
Yeah.
Has anyone seen a toad?
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.
Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see,
then.
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?
I've only tried a few simple ones
myself...
...but they've all worked for me.
For example:
Oculus Reparo.
That's better, isn't it?
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!
I'm Hermione Granger. And you are...?
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.
You two better change into robes. I
expect we'll be arriving soon.
You've got dirt on your nose. Did you
know?
Just there.
Right, then. First years, this way,
please!
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.
Wicked.
Welcome to Hogwarts.
Shortly, you'll pass through these
doors and join your classmates.
But before you take your seats, you
must be sorted into your houses.
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
While you're here, your house will be
like your family.
Your triumphs will earn you points.
Any rule-breaking and you will lose
points.
At the end of the year, the house with
the most points wins the house cup.
Trevor!
Sorry.
The Sorting Ceremony will begin
momentarily.
It's true then, what they're saying on
the train.
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.
Harry Potter?
This is Crabbe and Goyle.
And I'm Malfoy.
Draco Malfoy.
Think my name's funny, do you? I've no
need to ask yours.
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe? You
must be a Weasley.
You'll find out some wizarding
families are better than others.
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.
I can help you there.
I think I can tell the wrong sort for
myself, thanks.
We're ready for you now. Follow me.
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.
I read about it in Hogwarts, A
History.
Will you wait along here, please?
Now, before we begin...
...Professor Dumbledore would like to
say a few words.
I have a few start-of-term notices I
wish to announce.
The first years, please note...
...that the Dark Forest is strictly
forbidden to all students.
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has
asked me to remind you...
...that the third-floor corridor is
out of bounds...
...to everyone who does not wish to
die a most painful death.
Thank you.
When I call your name, you will come
forth.
I shall place the Sorting Hat on your
head...
...and you will be sorted into your
houses.
Hermione Granger.
Oh, no. Okay, relax.
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.
Right, then. Right.
Okay. Gryffindor!
Draco Malfoy.
Slytherin!
Every wizard who went bad was in
Slytherin.
Susan Bones.
Harry, what is it?
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.
Let's see....
I know! Hufflepuff!
Ronald Weasley.
Another Weasley! I know just what to
do with you.
Gryffindor!
Harry Potter.
Difficult, very difficult.
Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad
mind, either.
There's talent, oh, yes.
And a thirst to prove yourself.
But where to put you?
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?
You could be great, you know. It's all
here, in your head.
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.
No? Well, if you're sure.
Better be...
...Gryffindor!
Your attention, please.
Let the feast begin.
I'm half and half.
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.
Bit of a nasty shock for him when he
found out.
Percy, who's that teacher talking to
Professor Quirrell?
Professor Snape, head of Slytherin
house.
- What's he teach?
- Potions.
But he fancies the Dark Arts. He's
been after Quirrell's job for years.
Hello! How are you?
Welcome to Gryffindor.
It's the Bloody Baron!
Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice
summer?
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.
I know you. You're Nearly Headless
Nick.
I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't
mind.
"Nearly" headless? How can you be
nearly headless?
Like this.
Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep
up. Thank you.
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.
This is the most direct path to the
dormitories.
Keep an eye on the staircases. They
like to change.
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.
That picture's moving.
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.
- Look!
- Who's that girl?
Welcome to Hogwarts.
Password?
Caput Draconis.
Follow me, everyone. Keep up. Quickly,
come on.
Gather around here.
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.
Boys'dormitory is upstairs to the
left. Girls, the same on your right.
Your belongings have already been
brought up.
Made it!
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.
It'd be better if I transfigured Mr.
Potter and you into a watch.
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.
Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't
need one to find your seats.
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.
As such, I don't expect many of you to
appreciate...
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.
However, for those select few...
...who possess the predisposition...
...I can teach you how to bewitch the
mind...
...and ensnare the senses.
I can tell you how to bottle fame...
...brew glory and even put a stopper
in death.
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts in possession of
abilities...
...so formidable that you feel
confident enough...
...to not pay attention.
Mr. Potter.
Our new celebrity.
What would I get if I added root of
asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
You don't know? Let's try again.
Where would you look if I asked you to
find a bezoar?
I don't know, sir.
What is the difference between
monkshood and wolfsbane?
I don't know, sir.
Pity.
Clearly, fame isn't everything...
...is it, Mr. Potter?
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum Turn
this water into rum
Eye of rabbit....
What's Seamus trying to do to the
water?
Turn it to rum. Actually managed a
weak tea yesterday, before--
Mail's here.
Can I borrow this? Thanks.
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.
The problem is, I can't remember what
I've forgotten.
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.
"Believed to be the work of Dark
wizards or witches...
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge the
breach but insist nothing was taken.
The vault in question, number 713, had
been emptied earlier that same day."
That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid
and I went to.
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
Good afternoon, Amanda. Good
afternoon.
Welcome to your first flying lesson.
What are you waiting for? Step up to
your broomstick.
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."
Up!
Up.
Up.
Up. Up!
With feeling.
Shut up, Harry.
Now, once you've got hold of your
broom, I want you to mount it.
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.
When I blow my whistle, I want you to
kick off from the ground, hard.
Keep your broom steady, hover for a
moment...
...then lean forward slightly and
touch back down.
On my whistle. Three, two....
Mr. Longbottom.
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!
Neville!
Come back down this instant!
Everyone out of the way!
Is he all right?
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist. Poor
boy. Come on now, up you get.
Keep your feet on the ground while I
take him to the hospital wing.
Understand? If I see a single broom in
the air...
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.
Did you see his face?
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.
Give it here, Malfoy.
No. I'll leave it somewhere for
Longbottom to find.
How about on the roof?
What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond
your reach?
Harry, no way! You heard what Madam
Hooch said.
Besides, you don't know how to fly.
What an idiot.
Give it here or I'll knock you off
your broom!
Is that so?
Have it your way, then.
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!
Harry Potter!
Follow me.
You wait here.
Professor Quirrell, excuse me. Could I
borrow Wood for a moment?
Yes, of course.
Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I
have found you a Seeker.
Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new
Gryffindor Seeker.
I always knew he'd do well.
Seeker? But first years never make the
house teams.
- You must be the youngest player in--
- A century, McGonagall says.
Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us.
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.
Our job is to make sure you don't get
bloodied up too bad.
Can't make any promises. Rough game,
Quidditch.
But no one's died in years. Someone
vanishes occasionally.
But they'll turn up in a month or two.
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.
I've never played. What if I make a
fool of myself?
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.
You never told me your father was a
Seeker too.
I didn't know.
I'm telling you, it's spooky. She
knows more about you than you do.
Who doesn't?
What's happening?
The staircases change, remember?
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.
Does anybody feel like we shouldn't be
here?
We're not supposed to be here.
This is the third floor. It's
forbidden.
Let's go.
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!
Quick, let's hide through that door!
- It's locked!
- We're done for!
Move over!
Alohomora.
Get in.
Alohomora?
Standard Book of Spells, chapter
seven.
Anyone here, my sweet?
Come on.
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?
Didn't you see what it was standing
on?
I wasn't looking at its feet! I was
preoccupied with its heads.
Or maybe you didn't notice. There were
three!
It was standing on a trap door. It
wasn't there by accident.
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?
That's right. Now, if you two don't
mind, I'm going to bed...
...before you come up with another
idea to get us killed.
Or worse, expelled.
She needs to sort out her priorities.
Quidditch is easy to understand. Each
team has seven players.
Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper
and a Seeker. That's you.
There are three kinds of balls. This
one's called the Quaffle.
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.
The Keeper, that's me, defends the
hoops. With me so far?
I think so. What are those?
You better take this.
Careful now, it's coming back.
Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair
Beater.
What was that?
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.
But you are a Seeker.
The only thing I want you to worry
about is this.
The Golden Snitch.
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.
Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn
near impossible to see.
What do I do with it?
You catch it. Before the other team's
Seeker.
You catch this, the game's over.
You catch this, Potter, and we win.
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...
...or the ability to make objects fly.
Do you have your feathers? Good.
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.
The swish and flick. Everyone.
The swish and flick. Good. Oh, and
enunciate.
Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go, then.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Wingardium Leviosa.
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going to
take someone's eye out.
Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's
Leviosa, not Leviosar.
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Well done! See here, everyone, Miss
Granger's done it!
Splendid!
Well done, dear.
I think we're going to need another
feather over here.
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
She's a nightmare, honestly! No wonder
she hasn't got any friends.
I think she heard you.
Where's Hermione?
Parvati said she wouldn't come out of
the bathroom.
She said that she'd been in there all
afternoon, crying.
Troll in the dungeon!
Troll in the dungeon!
Thought you ought to know.
Silence!
Everyone will please not panic!
Now...
...prefects will lead their house back
to the dormitories.
Teachers will follow me to the
dungeons.
Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay
alert.
How could a troll get in?
Not on its own. Trolls are really
stupid. Probably people playing jokes.
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.
I think the troll's left the dungeon.
It's going into the girls'bathroom.
Hermione, move!

See why I've got to go back to
Hogwarts?

Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?

Hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?

Harry Potter might not want to

Excuse me, little girl, this for Daily Prophet
it can't be Harry Potter?
Harry, watch out, excuse me, mam
Nice big smile, Harry, to get you and I together on front page
Ladies and gentlemen,What an
extraordinary moment this is!
When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning
to purchase my autobiography, magical me
which incidently is carried out to celerbrate its
twenty seventh week top Daily Prophet best selling day
he has no idea,that he wouldn't in fact believing
with my entire collected works free of charge
oh....
now, ladies
give me those, let me get them signed
all of you wait outside, let's drop
I bet you love that, didn't you, Potter?
famous Harry Potter,Can't even go into a bookshop
without making the front page.
leave him alone
Harry Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend
not now,Draco, be nicely
it's Potter
Lucius Malfoy, we meet at last
forgive me, your scar is legended
as,of course, the wizard who gave to you
Voldemort killed my parents
he is nothing more than a murderer
en, you must be very brave to mention his name
or could be foolish
fearful name only creats a fearful thing itsself
and you must be Mrs Granger
yes, Draco told me all about you
and your parents
Muggles, aren't they?
let me see, red hair,
vacant expressions,
secondhand book you must be with Weasley's
children, It's smelling in here, let's go outside.
Well, well, well, Weasley's here now
Lucius
this is time of ministry, Arthur, with all those raids
I do hope they're paying you overtime?no judge like state of this,I'd say, no,
what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?
We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,Malfoy
clearly,
associating with muggles
I thought your family could sink no lower
I'll see you at work
see you at school
10:58, come on, come on,train will be leaving any moment
train, George, Percy, you first
after you, dear
come on, Ginny, get your seat, hurry
let's go
ai, what do you think you are doing?
sorry
lost control of trolley
why can't we get through
I don't know, the gateway sealed itself for some reason
the train leaves at exactly 11 clock, we missed it
Harry, if we can't through,
maybe mom and dad can't get back
maybe we just go to wait by the car
the car
Ron, I should tell you
Most muggles aren't customed to see a flying car
eh, right
oh, no,the Invisibility Booster must be faulty
oh, come then, let's go lower
we need to find the train
ok
now all we need to do is catching with the train
can't be far behind
can you hear that?
must be getting close
hold on
Harry, hold on
take my hand
hold on
I am trying
your hand on sweating
I think we found the train
yeah
welcome home!
up up
it's not working
try that tree!
stop, stop, stop!

look at my wand
thanks this wand for your neck
what's happenning?
I don't know
come on, go, fast
Scabbers, you are ok?
the car...
dad gonna kill me
see you, Hedwig.
wait
so, a house elf shows up in my bedroom
we can't get through the barrier
to get platform nine and three-quarters
we almost get killed by a tree
clearly someone just want me hurt this year
well, take a good look, lads
this night might well be the last you spend in this castle
oh, dear, we are in trouble
you were seen by no less than 7 muggles
do you have any idea how serious this is?
you have risked to expose our world
not to mention that damage and inflict on Whomping Willow which is on the ground since before you were born
Honestly, Professor Snape
I think it did more damage to us
Silence!
I will assure you,
were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me
the both of you would be
on the train home tonight! as it is
they are not
Professor Dumbledore
Professor McGonagall
Headmaster
these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, as such
I well aware of our rules,Severus
have reading quite a few of them myself
en, but their head are in Gryffindor House
it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action
we're going to get our stuff then
what are you talking about? Mr. Weasley?
you are going to expel us, aren't you?
Not today, Mr.Weasley
but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done
I'll be writing to your families tonight
and you'll both receive detention
good morning every one!
good morning, Professor Sprout
welcome to greenhouse
three second year
gather around, now, everyone
today,We are going to repot Mandrakes .
Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root?
yes, Mrs Granger?
Mandrake, or Mandragora
It is used to return those who have been petrified
to their original state
it is also quite dangerous, Mandrake cry's fatal to anyone who hears it,"
Excellent
Ten points to Gryffindor
now, as our mandrakes are still only seedlings
their crys won't kill you yet
but they will knock you out several hours
that's why I give each of you a pair of earmuffs
for all of your protections,
so could you please put them on right away
quickly
flats tight down
watch me closely
you grasp your mandrake firmly
you pull it
sharply out of pot
go get it, and now
you dump it down to other pot and
pour it little sprinky soil
till it can't move
ah, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs
no, Mam,
he is just fainted
ah, as well, let's leave him back
right, here we go
plenty pots to go around
grasp your mandrake and pull it up
hey, is that nearly headless, isn't it?
hello, Percy! Mr Clearwater
hello, Headless Nicholas
say it, I am doomed
you're doomed
hey, Harry
I'm Colin Creevey
I'm in Gryffindor, too.
hey, Colin, nice to meet you
Ron, is that your owl?
bloody bird, it is a mess
oh, no
look, every one, Weasley got himself
a howler
go on, Ron,
I ignored one from my Gran once, it was horrible
WHAT A WEASLEY!
HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR?
I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING
YOUR FATHER IS NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK
AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!
IF
YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE
WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME.
Oh, Ginny dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor
your father and I are so proud of it
let me introduce you
to your new defense against dark art teacher
me
Gilderoy Lockhart
Order of Merlin, Third Class
Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner
of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award
but I don't talk about that
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!
Now, be warned
It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind!
You may find yourselves
facing your worst fears in this room.
Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.
I must ask you not to scream
it might provoke them
Cornish pixies
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
lots of you aren't fear of them,the pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters
Let's see what you make of them!
Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies
hey, please, get me down
get off me,
stop, stop, hold still
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!
Well, I'll ask you three
to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.
what we do now?
immobilas
why it is always me?
I spent this summer devising an all new Quidditch program
we are going to train
earlier
harder, and longer
what?
I don't believe it
what do you think you are going? Flint
Quidditch practice
I booked the patch for Gryffindor today
easy,Woods, I've got note
oh, a small trouble
I, Professor Severus Snape, hereby
give the Slytherin team permission to practice today
owing to the need to train their new Seeker.
you got new seeker, who?
Malfoy?
that's right,that's not always you want to see it
those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones, how did you get those?
gift from Draco's father
you see, Weasley, unlike some
my father can afford the best
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in
They got in on pure talent.
No one asked your opinion
you fiIthy little Mudblood
you will pay for that one, Malfoy, eat slugs
you ok? Ron?
say something
well, can you turn around, Harry
no, Colin, get out the way
let's take him to Hagrid
how long it'll do?
opps, this calls the real special equipment
nothing to do but wait for it to stop,I am afraid
Better out than in, who's he tried to curse, anyway?
Malfoy
he called Hermione
A..., well,I don't know exactly what it means
he called me mudblood
he did not
what's mudblood?
it means dirty blood
Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born
some one with no magic parents
some one like me
it's sort of tongue when you usually hear stuff in conversation
so thing is, Harry
there are some wizards - like Malfoy's family
who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood
it's horrible
it's disgusting
aren't just call what up to birth
dirty blood, there is no wizard alive day that is no halfblood or less
more to the point, not yet a sigle spell our Hermione can' do
come here
don't you think on it, Hermione
don't you think on it for one minute
Harry, Harry, harry, can you possibly imagine?
a better way to serve the detention?
by helping me to answer my fan mail?
not really
Fame's a fickle friend, Harry
Celebrity is as celebrity does
remember that
what?
sorry?
that voice
voice?
didn't you hear it?
what are you talking about? Harry
are you getting a lit bit drowsy?
Great Scott -no wonder, look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours!
spooky, how the time flys when we're having fun
spooky
Harry!
did you hear it?
hear what?
that voice
voice? what voice?
I heard it first at Lockhart office, then again, it just
it's moving
I think it's gonna kill
kill?
Harry, wait, don't be so fast
strange
I've never seen spiders act like that
I don't like spiders
what's that?
the chamber of secret has been opened
enemies of the heir...be ware
it's written in blood
oh, no
enemies of heir, be ware
you'll be the next, mudblood
what's going on there? go out of my way, my way, my way
Potter? what do you......
you murdered my cat
no, no
I'll kill ya
I'll kill ya!
Argus!
Argus!
every one will proceed to dormitory immediately,
every one, except,
you three
...Gryffindors, follow me...
she is not dead, Argus
she has been petrified
ah, Potter,so unluck I wasn't there
I know the exact the countercurse that could've spare her
but how she's been petrified, I can not say
ask him
he must've done it, you saw what he wrote on the wall
it is not true, sir, I swear
I've never touch Mrs. Norris
rubbish
If I might, Headmaster?
perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time
however
the circumstances are suspicious
I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner
I am afraid that's my doing, Severus
you see, Harry's helping answer my fan mail
that's why Ron and I're looking for him,professor
we just found when he said
yes, Mrs Granger?
when I said I wasn't hungry
we were heading back to common room when we found Mrs. Norris
innocent until proven guilty,Severus
my cat has been petrified
I want to see some punishment
we will be able to cure her,Argus
as I understand
at the mean time, I strongly recommend caution
to all
it's bit strange, isn't it?
strange?
you heard the voice,
it's just strange
do you think I should've told them, Dumbledore and others, I mean
are you mad?
no,Harry, even in the wizard world, hearding voices isn't a good sign
she is right, you know
could I have your attention please?
right, now, today we will be transforming animals
into water goblets
like this,1, 2, 3
fetherfethertol
now, it's your turn
well, who would like to go first
oh, Mr.Weasley, 1, 2, 3, fetherfethertol
fethervertol
that one need replacing,
Mr.Weasley
yes, Mrs Granger
professor, I was wondering
If you can tell us,about,the chamber of secret
very well, you all knew, of course
Hogwart was founded over thousands years ago by the four greatest wizards and witches of age
Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
three of the founders concensused quite harmoniously
one did not, so we guess it is who
Slytherin wished to be more selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts.
He believed
that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.
in another words, pure blood
unable to persuade others, he desided to leave the school
now, according to legend
Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle
known as the chamber of secret
though shockly, before departed, he sealed it
until that time when his own true heir returned to the school
the heir alone will be able to open the chamber
and unleash the horror within, and by so doing
to purge the school of all those who in Slytherin's view were unworthy to study magic.
muggleborn
Naturally,the school
has been searched many times
no such chamber has been found
professor
what's exactly the legend tell us the light in the chamber?
the chamber is said to be home to something
that only the heir of Slytherin
can control
it is said to be the home of a monster
so it is true, she told us there is really a chamber of secret
yes, could you tell?
McGonagall's worried and all the teachers are
and if there is really a chamber of secret and really hasn't been opened
that means,
the heir of Slytherin has returned Hogwart
the question is, who is it?
that's stink,who do we know
who thinks all muggleborns are scums
If you're talking about Malfoy
of course, you heard him
You'll be next,Mudbloods! I heard him
but,Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
maybe Ron is right, Hermione
I mean, look at his family,The whole lot
of them have been in Slytherin for centuries
Crabbe and Goyle must know,maybe we can trick him to tell them
even they aren't that pig, but there might be another way
remind you, it would be difficult
not mention we'll break about 50 school rules
and it'll be dangerous
very dangerous
here it is
Polyjuice Potion.
properly brewed Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporaly into phisical form of other
here,you know,if Harry and I drink that stuff
we'll turn to Crabbe and Goyle
yes
you kidding..
Malfoy'll tell us anything
exactly
but truth is I've never see a more complicated potion
eh, well, how long will it take to make?
a month
a month
but, Hermione, if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin, he could've attacked half muggleborns in the school by then
I know
but it's the only plan we got
another ball for Slytherin
they lead Gryffindor 90 to 30
All right there,
Scarhead?
watch yourself, Harry
wood, look out
Hermione
Harry got himself a wild Bludger
let's be tempered, we said, us
no, stop it
no,
even with proper one is too risky
even with proper one is too risky
you could hurt Harry
training for the ballet, Potter?
you gonna catch me? Potter?
let's go
Harry Potter caught the Snitch, Gryffindor win!
thank you
are you ok?
no, I think my arm broke
do not worry, Harry
I will fix that of your arms straight away
no, not you
you don't know what are you saying...now
this won't hurt a bit
BRAKYAMY IMENDO
ah,yes, well, that can sometimes happen
but the point is you can no longer feel any pain
and very clearly, the bones are not broken
broken? there is no bones left
much more flexible though
oh, Mr Malfoy I will make things as fast as you can go
out my way, out my way
You should have come straight to me!
I can mend bones in a hard speed - but growing them back
You will be able to, won't you?
I'll be able to, certainly,
but it will be painful
You're in for a rough night, Potter
regrowing bones is a nasty bussiness
what do you expect? Pumkin juice?
hello
Dobby?
Harry Potter should've listened to Dobby
Harry Potter should've gone back home when he missed the train
it was you,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through!
Indeed, yes, sir
you nearly got Ron and me expelled
at least you would be away from here
Harry Potter must go home
Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see the...
your Bludger? you made that Bludger chase after me?
Dobby feels the most grief, sir
Dobby had to iron his hands
You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
I don't suppose you could tell me why you tried to kill me?
not kill you, sir, never kill you
Dobby remmeber Harry Potter before Harry Potter trumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
We house-elfs were treated like vermin, sir!
Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin
ah..ah....
why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
This, sir? This a mark of the house-elf's enslavement
Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes
listen, listen, terrible thing is about to happen in Hogwart
Harry Potter must not stay here
Now, that history is to repeat itself
repeat itself, you mean this' happened before?
eh--I shouldn't have said that
bad Dobby
stop
stop, stop, Dobby
tell me, Dobby
when did this happen before?
who is doing it now?
Dobby can not say, sir
Dobby only want Harry potter to be safe
no, Dobby, tell me, who is it?
put him here
what happened?
there's been another attack
I think, do you know,I think
he's been petrified,Madam Pomfrey.
you don't think
perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker?
What can this mean, Albus?
it means our students are in great danger
what you have to tell the staff?
the truth, tell them, the Hogwart is no longer safe
it is as we feared, meanever
that the Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
again? you mean the chamber of secret had been opened before?
of course
don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened the Chamber when he was at school here
now he's told Draco how to do it
maybe, but we have to wait Polyjuice potion to make sure
and why it's me,why are we brewing this potion in poor daylight in the middle of girl's never treat
don't you think we'll get caught?
no
no one ever comes in here
why? Moaning Myrtle
who?
Moaning Myrtle
who is Moaning Myrtle?
I am Moaning Myrtle
I wouldn't expect you to know me
who would ever talk about ugly,miserable,moping, Moaning Myrtle?
she is a little sensitive
gather around,
gather around, can everybody see me?
can you all hear me? excellent
in lights of dark events
of recent weeks Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission
to start this little dueling club, to train you all up
in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself
have done on countless occasions to full details, see my published works
let me introduce my assistant
professor Snape
he has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration
Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry
you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him,
never fear!
1,2,3
Expelliarmus!
do you think he is all right?
who cares?
an excellent idea to show them that,Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying
it was pretty obvious what you were about to do.
If I had wanted to stop you
it would have been only too easy
perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the student
to block unfriendly spell, professor
Excellent suggestion, professor Snape
let's have volunteer pair
Potter,Weasley, how about you?
Weasley is one causes devastation with simpliest spell
who sent Harry Potter to
hospital wing in match box
may I suggest some one from my own house?
Malfoy? perhaps?
good luck, Potter
yea,sir
wands at ready
scared? Potter
you wish
on the count of three
cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm
we don't want any accidents here
1,2
Ivertasvaty
Rictusempra!
I said disarm only
Serpensortia!
don't move, Potter
I get rid of it for you
allow me, professor Snape
WOLATIOUSENDULY
SAYASASI
SYASIHAIS
SYASIHAIS
IPARAIAPYSKE
what are you playing at
You're a Parselmouth. Why didn't you tell us?
I am a what?
you can talk to snakes? I know, I mean I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once,
once, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.
no
they can't,It's not a very common gift. Harry
this is bad
what's bad?
if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -
Oh, that's what you said to it?
you were there, you heard me
I heard you speaking Parseltongue, snake language
I spoke in different language?
but I didn't realize it
how could I speak a language
without knowing I can
I don't how it does, but sound like you acted signal or something
Harry, listen to me as the
vision symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth, he could talk to snakes too
exactly
And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something
but I am not
it can't be, he lived thousands years ago, for we know, you could be
see you back in common room
Caught in the act!
all that will be acted, Potter
no,
Mr.Filch you don't understand
professor, I swear I didn't...
this is out of my hands, Potter
Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you
SHEBERDLEMON
professor Dumbledore?
Bee in your bonnet, Potter
eh, eh, I was, I was just wandering if you put me in the right house
yes
you were particularly diffcult to place
But I stand by what I said last year
you would've done well in Slytherin
you are wrong
Harry
Professor, sir...your bird
there was nothing I could do
he just caught fire
oh, about time, too
he's been looking dreadful for days
pity,you had to see him on a Burning Day
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
they burst into flame when it is time for them to die
and they are .
reborn from the ashes
oh, that's Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
They can carry immensely heavy loads,
their tears have healing powers
Professor Dumbledore,sir, wait,
listen
Professor Dumbledore,sir,it wasn't harry
Hagrid
in fact I prepare to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic
Hagrid!
relax
I do not think that Harry attacked any one.
of course you don't
oh, ..oh,great! ...then...
I'll just wait outside
you don't think it was me, Professor?
no, Harry, I do not think it was you
but I must ask you
is there something you wish to tell me?
no sir
very well, then, off you go
everything is set, we just need a bit who you change into
Crabbe and Goyle
we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy
how?
I've got it all worked out
I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught
simple but powerful
now,once they are asleep
hide them in a broom closet and pull out a few of their hairs
and put their uniforms
Whose hair are you ripping out then?
I 've alreaday got mine
Millicent Bulstrode in Slytherin
I got this off her robes
I am going to check on the polyjuice potion
make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these
Ron,maybe, maybe I should do it
yeah, right
MAGADIMIGOSA
good
cool
how thick could you get?
come on, let's get them
we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
add the hairs
erh...essence of Crabbe
cheers
I think I am gonna be sick
me too
Harry?
Ron?
bloody hell
we still sound like ourselves
you need sound more like Grabbe
bloody hell
excellent
but where is Hermione
I...I don't think I am going
you go without me
Hermione, are you ok?
just go
you're wasting time
come on
I think Slytherin common room is this way
excuse me
what are you doing down....
I mean, what are you doing down here?
I happen to be a school prefect
you on the other hand have no bussiness
wondering the corridors at this time of night
what's your name again?
eh, I'm....
Crabbe and Goyle
where have you two been?
pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?
why are you wearing glasses?
I...,I am reading
reading?
I didn't know you could read
what are you doing down here, Weasley?
mind your attitude, Malfoy
well, sit down
you never know that Weasleys were pure-bloods
the way they behave
they are emmbassing the wizarding world, all of them
what's wrong with you? Crabbe
stomachach
You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done any report of all these attacks
I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up.
Father's always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that's ever happened to this place.
you're wrong
what?
you think some one here is worse than Dumbledore?
well, do you?
Harry Potter?
good one, Goyle, you absolutely right
Saint Potter
And people actually think he's heir Slytherin !
but then you must have some idea who is behind it all
you know I don't, Goyle
I told you yesterday
how many times do I have to tell you?
is this yours?
but my father did say this
it's been 50 years since the chamber was opened
he wouldn't tell me who opened it
only they were spelled
the last time
the chamber of secret was opened
a mudblood died
so it's only matter of time
before one of them's killed this time
as to me
I hope it's Granger
what's the matter with you two
you're acting very odd
it's his stomachache
calm down
scar
hey, where are you going?
that was close
Hermione, come on, we've got loads to tell you
go away
wait you'll see
it's awful
Hermione, are you ok?
do you remmeber me telling you?
the polyjuice potion is only for the human transformations
it was cat hair I pulled off Millicent Bulstrode's robes
look at my face
look at your tail
we spoke to Hermione
she'll sleep in hospital for a few days
when she stop coughing out furballs
what's this?
yark,looks like Moaning Myrtle flooded the bathroom
Come to throw something else at me?
Why would I throw something at you?
don't ask me
Here I am,minding my own business,
and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me ......
But it can't hurt you if someone throws something at you
I mean, it'd just go right through you
so!!Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it!
Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!
but,Who threw it at you, anyway?
I don't know
I didn't see them
I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death
and it fell right through the top of my head
Tom Maryold Riddle
my name is Harry Potter
"Hello, Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle"
do you know anything about
the chamber of secrets
"yes"
can you tell me?
"no"
"but I can show you"
"let me take you back fifty years ago"
"13th June"
excuse me
could you tell me what's going on here?
are you Tom Riddle?
Hello, can you hear me?
"Riddle"
up
Professor Dumbledore
Dumbledore
it is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom
yes, professor, I suppose
I have to see it for myself if the rumor was true
I am afraid, they are, Tom, they are true
well this school
as well
I don't have home to go to, sir
they won't really close Hogwart, would they, professor?
I understand, Tom
I am afraid
headmaster Dipper may have no choice
sir, if it all stoped
the person who's responsible was caught
is there something you wish to tell me?
no sir
nothing
very well then
off you go
goodnight, sir
what's going on there?
evening, Hagrid
I am going to turn you in, Hagrid
I don't think you meant to kill any one,but
you can't,you don't understand
The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow.
The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ......
it wasn't him
Aragog never kill no one, never
monsters don't make good pets,Hagrid
just stand aside
no
Stand aside, Hagrid
no
SESYTENOPEYIDE
ORONYIEXRTIN
Aragog! Aragog!
I can't let you go
I have you warned for this, Hagrid
you would be expelled
Hagrid
it was Hagrid
Hagrid opened the chamber of secret 50 years ago
it can't be Hagrid, just can't be
we don't even know this Tom Riddle
he sound like a dirty rotten snitch to me
the monster had killed somebody, Ron
what if he has done?
look, Hagrid's our friend
why don't why just go and ask him about it?
That'd be a cheerful visit
Hello, Hagrid. Tell us,
have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?
mad and hairy?
you wouldn't be talking about me, now,would you?
no
what's that you got, Hagrid?
oh, it's Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent
for the mandrake, you know
according to proffessor Sprout, they still gonna need bit grown-up to do, but once their acne's been cleared up, we'll be able to chop them up, stew them,and then we'll get those people down at hospital unpetrified
in meantime,you know, you three, best look after yourselves
all right?
hello, Nevill
Harry, I don't who did it, but you'd be better come
come on
it has to be a Gryffindor
nobody else know our password
unless he wasn't a student
whoever he was, he must be looking something
he found it
Tom Riddle's diary is gone
oh, well, listen up
we play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance
stronger, quicker, and smarter
not to mention they're deadly scared that Harry'll petrify any one near him
oh, that too
professor McGonagall
this match has been cancelled
you can't cancell quidditch
silence, wood
you and your teammates will go to Gryffindor tower, now
Potter
you and I will find Mr.Weasley
there are someting the both of you'll have to see
I warn you
This could be a bit of a shock
Hermione!
she was found near the library
alone with this
does it mean anything
to either of you?
no
could I have your attention please
becasue of recent events,
these new rules will be put effect immediately
all students will return to their house common room by six clock every evening
all students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher
no exceptions
I should tell you this
unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught
it is likely the school will be closed
we got to talk to Hagrid, Ron
I can't believe it's him
if he did set the monster loose last time
he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets
that's a start
but you heard McGonagall
but we are not allowed to leave tower except class
I think
it's the time to get my dad's old cloak again
who's there?
hello? hello?
what's that for?
oh, nothing,
I've being expecting..., and
it doesn't matter, come on in
just made a pot of tea
Hagrid, are you ok?
I'm worried, I am all right
did you hear about Hermone?
oh, yeah, I heard about that, all right
look, we have to ask you something
do you know who's opened the chamber of secrets?
what you have to understand about that is
quick, under the cloak
don't say a word, quiet, both of you
proffessor Dumbledor, sir
good evening, Hagrid
I wonder, could we?..
of course,come in
come in
that's dad's boss
Cornelius Fudge,
the Minister of Magic!
Bad business, Hagrid,Very bad business.
Had to come. three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act.
I never,You know I never, Professor
I want it understood, Cornelius,
that Hagrid has my full confidence
Albus Look,
Hagrid's record is against him.
I've got to take him
take me?
take me where? Not Azkaban prison?
I am afraid we have no choice, Hagrid
already here, Fudge, good
what are you doing here?
get out of my house
believe me,I absolutely have no pleasure at all being inside your - er
you call this a house?
I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.
and what exactly is it that you want with me?
the other governors and I desided it's time for you to step aside.
This is an Order of Suspension
you'll find all twelve signatures on it.
I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch.
well, with all those attacks
there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts
I can only imagin what an awful loss that would be to the school.
you can't take professor Dumbledore away
take him away, the muggleborns won't stand a chance
you have my word, There'll be killing next!
you think so
Calm yourself, Hagrid
If the governors desire my removal
I will of course step aside
however
you will find the help will always be given to Hogwarts
to those who ask for it
any more sentiments?
shall we?
come, Hagrid
well
if
if anybody was looking some stuff
that all they have to do would be to follow the spiders
yeah, that will lead them right
that's all I have to say
oh, well,some one need to feed Fang when I am away
good boy
Hagrid is right
Dumbledor gone
here will be attack everyday
look
come on
come on, Fang
come on
what ?
you heard what Hagrid said
follow the spiders
they're heading to the dark forest
why spiders
why can't we follow the butterflies?
Harry, I don't like this
Harry, I don't like it at all
can we go back now?
come on
who is it?
don't panic
Hagrid, is that you?
we are friends of Hagrid's
and you
you are Aragog, aren't you?
yes
Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before
he is in trouble, up in the school, for the punish
of attacks
they think it's Hagrid
they think he open the chamber of secrets
they think he opened the chamber of secrets
like before
that's a lie
Hagrid'd never opened the chamber of the secrets
then ,you are not the monster
no
the monster was born in the castle
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler
but if you are not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago
we do not speak of it
it's an ancient creature
we spiders fear above all others
but have you seen it?
I never saw any part of the castle
with the books in which Hagrid kept me
the girl was discovered in bathroom
when I was accused,Hagrid brought me here
Harry
what?
well, thank you
we'll just go
go
I think not
My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command.
But I can not deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst.
goodbye
friends of Hagrid
can we go back now?
know any spells?
one
but it's not powerful enough for all of them
where is Hermione when you need her
let's go
RONIEGEZIMEIY
glad we're out there
ERMONIAEXPAY
thanks for that
don't mention it
get out of here
now
come on
come on, a little faster
go, go
get us in the air
the flying gear is jammed
come on
oh, I am trying
follow the spiders
follow the spiders
if Hagrid ever get out of Azkaban , I will kill him
I mean what was the point of sending us in there
what we found out?
we know one thing
Hagrid'd never opened the chamber of secrets
he was innocent
I wish you were here, Hermione
we need you
now more than ever
what's that?
Ron
this why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked
come on
of many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land
none is more more deadly than the Basilisk
capable of living for hundreds of years
instant death awaits any who meets this giantic serpent's eyes
Spiders flee before it
Ron, this is it
the monster in chamber of secrets is a basilisk
that's why I can hear its speak
it's a snake
but if it kills by looking people in the eye
why is it no one's died?
because no one did look in the eye
not directly at least
Colin saw it through his camera
Justin
Justin must've seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick!
Nick got the full blast of it, but he is a ghost, he couldn't die again
and Hermione
had the mirror
I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners in case it came along
and Mrs. Norris
I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or mirror, Harry
the water
that was the water on the floor that night
she only saw the Basilisk's reflection
spiders flee before it
it all fits
but how's Basilisk been getting around?
A
dirty great snake . . .
Someone would've seen it...
Hermione thought that too
pipes
it's using the plumbing
remmeber what Aragog said:
about that girl 50 years ago?
she died in the bathroom
what if she'd never left?
Moaning Myrtle?
All students to return to their House dormitories at once.
All teachers return to second floor corrider. Immediately
as you can see
the heir of Slytherin has left another message
the worst fear has been realized, a student has been taken by the monster
into the chamber itself
students must be sent to home
I am afraid this is the end of Hogwarts
so sorry, dozed off, what I missed
a girl has been snatched by the monster,Lockhart
your moment has come at last
my? no...no...
Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
that's settled
we will leave you to deal with the monster,Gilderoy
your skills, after all, are legend
very well
I'll just be in my office, getting...getting ready
who is it the monster has taken another?
Ginny Weasley
her Skeleton will lie in the chamber forever
Ginny...
Lockhart maybe useless,
but if He's going to try and get into the Chamber.
at least we can tell him what we know
professor, we have some information for you
are you going somewhere?
oh, yes, eh..
urgent call, unavoidable, got to go
what about my sister?
as for that, most unfortunate
no one regrets more than I
you are the defense against the dark art teacher
you can't go now
I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the job description about the...
you are running away?
After all that stuff you did in your books
Books can be misleading
you wrote them
my dear boy ,do you use your common sense?
My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things
you are a fraud
you've just been taking credit for other wizards have
done?
so anything you can do?
yes
now you mentioned it
I am rather gifted in memory charms
otherwise you see,all those wizards would've gone blabbing
and I'd never sold another book
in fact
I, eh, I am 'eh,going to have to do the thing to you
don't even think about it
oh, who's there?
oh, hello,Harry
what do you want?
to ask you how you died?
it was dreadful
it happened right here in this dirty cubicle
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses
I was crying
then I heard somebody come in
who was it, Myrtle?
I don't know
I was distrought!
but they said something funny a kind of madeup language,
and I realized it was a boy's speaking
so I unlocked the door to tell him, "go away"
and , I died..
just like that, how?
I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes.
over there by that sink
this is it
this is it,Ron,I think this is the entrance of chamber of secrets
say something
Harry, say something in Parseltongue.
excellent, Harry
ha, good work, then, I'll just be...
there is no need for me to stay
you first
no boys, what good it will do?
better you than us
you sure you don't want to test it first?
really quite filth down here
all right
let's go
oh, Harry
if you die down there, you are welcome to share my toilet
eh, thanks, Myrtle
now, remmeber
any signs of movement, close your eyes straight away
go on
this way
what is this?
it looks like a snake
it's snake skin
bloody hell
I am sure this must be 60 feet long
hard to a liar this one
adventure ends here,
boys
but don't fright
the world will know our story
but however it's too late to save the girl
how you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body
so, you first, Mr. Potter
say goodbye to your memories
Obliviate!
Harry Harry
Ron
Ron, are you ok?
I'm fine
Hello
who are you?
I'm Ron Weasley
Really
and who am I?
Lockhart's memory charm backfired
he hasn't got clue who he is
it's an odd sort of place, isn't it?
do you live here?
no
really? eh...
what do I do now?
you wait here
and try to shift some these rocks, so we can get back through
I'll go and find Ginny
ok
Ginny, oh, please don't be dead
wake up, wake up, please wake up
she won't wake
Tom
Tom Riddle?
what do you mean
she won't wake? she is not...
she's still alive
but only just
are you a ghost?
a memory, reserved in a diary for 50 years
she's cold as ice
Ginny, Please don't be dead
wake up
you got to help me, Tom, there is a Basilisk
It won't come until it is called
give me my wand, Tom
You won't be needing it
listen, we've got to go, we've got to save her
I am afraid I can't do that, Harry, you see
as poor Ginny growes weaker
I grow stronger
yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the chamber of secrets
no, she couldn't, she wouldn't
it was Ginny who set the Basilisk on mudblood and Filch's cat
Ginny wrote the frighten messages on the walls
why?
because I told her to
you'll find that I can be very persusive
not that Ginny knew what she was doing, she was
shall we say ,in a kind of trance
still, the power of diary began to scare her
she tried to dispose it in girl's bathroom
and then
you should find it, but you
the very person I was most anxious to meet
why did you want to meet me?
I knew I have to talk to you
meet you if I could
so I desided to show you my capture of that brainless Hagrid
to gain your trust
Hagrid is my friend
and you framed him, didn't you?
it was my word to against Hagrid
only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent
but Dumbledore saw right through you
he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the chamber again while I was still at school
so I desided to leave behind a diary
preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages
so that one day
I would be able to lead another
to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work
but you haven't finished it this time
in few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready
and every one who was petrified will be right to go
haven't I told you?
killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me any more?
For many months now, my new target
has been -you.
how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent
was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
How did you escape
with nothing but a scar
while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time ......
Voldemort is my past, present, and future
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
you
you are the heir of Slytherin
you are LORD VOLDEMORT
so we...you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?
no
I fashioned myself a new name
a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,
when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
he would never be gone.
not as long as those remain loyal to him
Fawkes?
so this is what Dumbledore sends his defender!
A songbird and an old hat!
Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin
against the famous Harry Potter
so, I have asks,
Potter,no one will save you
Potter,it only obeys me
no
your bird may have blinded Basilisk
but it can still hear you
yes,Potter
the process is nearly complete
in a few minutes
Ginny Weasley will be dead
and I will cease to be a memory
Lord Voldemort will return
very much alive
Ginny
remarkable, isn't it?
how quickly the venom of Basilisk can penetrate the body
I guess you have a little more than a minute to live
you will be with your dear mudblood mother, soon, Harry
funny
the damage a silly little book can do
especially in the hands of a silly little girl
what are you doing?
stop
no
Ginny
Harry
it was me
I swear
I didn't mean to
Riddle made me
Harry
you are hurt
Don't worry
Ginny
you need to get yourself out
follow the chamber,and you will find Ron
you were briliant, Fawkes
I just wasn't quick enough
of course
Phoenix tears have healing powers
thanks
it's all right, Ginny
it's over
it's just memory
amazing
this is just like magic
you both realized, of course
in the past few hours
you've broken perhaps a dozen school rules
yes, sir
there are sufficient evidence to have you expelled
yes, sir
yes, sir
therefore
it is only fitting
that you will both receive special awards for services to the school
thanks, sir
now, Mr.Weasley
if you would
have an hour to deliver this release paper to Azkaban
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back
Harry
First, I want to thank you, Harry
you must've shown me the real loyalty down the chamber
nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you
and second
I sense that something
is troubling you
am I right, Harry?
it's just
you see, sir,I couldn't help but notice certain thing, certain
certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me
I see, well
you can speak Parseltongue, ?
Harry, why?
because
Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue
if I am not mistaken, Harry
he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
not
intentionally
but yes
so the sorting hat was right
I should be in Slytherin
it is true, Harry
it was just many qualities Voldemort himself prizes
determination ,resourcefulness and if I may say so,a certain disregard for rules,
why then the sorting hat placed you in Gryffindor
because I asked it to
exactly, Harry,
Exactly
it makes you different from Voldemort
it is not our abilities that show what we truly are
it is our choices
if you want proof why you belong to Gryffindor and I suggest
you look more closely at this
Godric Gryffindor
it'd take a true Gryffindor to pull out of that hat
Dobby, so, this is your master
your family you serve is Malfoy's
I will deal with you later
out of my way
Potter
so, it is true
you have returned
when the governors learned Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into Chamber, they
saw fit to sending me back
ridiculars
curiously,Lucius
Several among them are under the impression that you would
curse their families
if they didn't want to agree to suspend me in the first place.
how dare you?
beg your pardon
my sole concern has always been,
and will always be
the welfare of school
and of course its students
the culprit has been identified
I would assume?
oh, yes
and who was it?
Voldemort
only this time he chosed to act
through somebody else
by means
of this
I see
fortuanately
our young Mr. Potter
discovered it

find their way into innocent hands,

that Mr. Potter will always be around

congratulations
I can't believe you solved it
well, we had loads of help from you
we couldn't have done it without you
thanks
could I have your attention please
before we begin the feast
let us have a round of applause for proffessor Sprout
Madam Pomfrey
whose mandrake juices's been sowed successfully and ministered to all who had been petrified
also, in the light of recent events
as a school treat
all exams have been cancelled
sorry
I am late
the owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused
some bloody bird called Eroll
I,now, just ought to say that,if it hasn't been for you, Harry and Ron
and Hermione, of course
I would, I'll be still, you know, where...
I just like to say, thanks
it's not Hogwarts without you, Hagrid
BOY:
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
HARRY:
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
WOMAN:
Harry. Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Uh....
Marge. How lovely to see--
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing. School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
-Oh, you're still here, are you?
-Yes.
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.
VERNON:
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
MARGE: Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
VERNON: Can l tempt you, Marge?
MARGE: Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 1 2 dogs.
Just a bit more. That's a boy.
Ah! You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution
for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. l've been beaten loads of times.
MARGE: Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?
PETUNlA: Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
-And a drunk too, no doubt?
-That's a lie.
-What did you say?
-My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up! Shut up!
Right. Let me tell you....
VERNON:
Oh....
MARGE:
Vernon!
Vernon! Vernon, do something!
Ow! Ripper! Ow....
Stop!
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.
MARGE: Hold on, hold on.
VERNON: Get off.
-Don't you dare!
VERNON: Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
VERNON:
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
-You put her right!
-No. She deserved what she got.
-Keep away from me.
-You can't do magic outside school.
-Yeah? Try me.
-They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and l will be
your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
-l fell over.
-What you fall over for?
-l didn't do it on purpose.
-Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
-What you looking at?
-Nothing.
Well, come on, then. ln.
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
SHUNPIKE:
Come on. Move on, move on.
SHUNPIKE: Take her away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
-What did you say your name was?
-l didn't.
-Whereabouts are you headed?
-The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.
HARRY: The Muggles. Can't they see us?
SHUNPIKE: Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
SHRUNKEN HEAD:
If you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight...
...seven, six, five...
...four, three, three and a half...
...two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that? That man.
Who is that?
Who is--?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.
-How did he escape?
-Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of...
...You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys? Guys?
Why the long faces?
SHRUNKEN HEAD:
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.
The Leaky Cauldron.
SHRUNKEN HEAD:
Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Ah. Mr. Potter, at last.
SHUNPIKE: Take it away, Ern.
SHRUNKEN HEAD: Take it away!
TOM:
Room 1 1 .
Hedwig.
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.
FUDGE: As Minister for Magic,
it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that...
...and no harm done.
FUDGE:
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
-Minister?
-Yes?
-l don't understand.
-Understand?
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...
...for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...
...was very, very irresponsible.
-"The state of things," sir?
-We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...
...wander.
VENDOR: Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?
WlTCH MAID:
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
BOY:
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or l'll turn it into a tea cozy.
HERMlONE: lt's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
-lt's in his nature.
-A cat? Is that what they told you?
-Looks like a pig with hair.
HERMlONE: That's rich...
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.
Harry.
HARRY: Egypt. What's it like?
-Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
-Egyptians used to worship cats.
-Along with the dung beetle.
GEORGE: Not flashing that clipping again?
-l haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
GEORGE: The day maid.
-Night maid.
GEORGE: Cook.
-The bloke who fixed the toilet.
-Harry.
HARRY: Mrs. Weasley.
-Good to see you, dear.
-Good to see you.
-Got everything?
-Yes.
-Yes? All your books?
-lt's all upstairs.
-Your clothes?
-Everything.
-Good boy.
-Thank you.
-Harry Potter.
HARRY: Mr. Weasley.
-Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
-Yeah, sure.
MR. WEASLEY: Hermione.
HERMlONE: Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
-Looking forward to a new term?
-Yeah. It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...
...from divulging what l'm about
to reveal to you.
But l think that you need
to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?
-Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
-Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped....
-Voldemort.
-Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who...
...Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.
And in his mind...
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.
And that is why...
...he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...
...you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley...
...why would l go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?
MRS. WEASLEY:
Quick. Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
HARRY:
I didn't mean to blow her up. l just--
-l lost control.
RON: Brilliant.
HERMlONE: Honestly, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
RON:
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on. Everywhere else is full.
RON:
Who do you think that is?
-Professor R.J. Lupin.
RON: Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
-lt's on his suitcase, Ronald.
-Oh.
HARRY: Do you think he's really asleep?
-Seems to be. Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...
-...to come after you?
HARRY: Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
-l mean, everyone's looking for him.
-Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...
-...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
-Thanks, Ron.
HERMlONE:
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell! What's happening?
HERMlONE:
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
LUPlN:
Here, eat this. lt'll help.
It's all right. lt's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. lt's gone now.
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, l need to have
a little word with the driver.
Eat. You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.
And did either of you two...
...you know...
-...pass out?
-No.
I felt weird, though.
Like l'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.
Now, l'd like to say a few words...
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter. Potter. ls it true you fainted?
-l mean, you actually fainted?
-Shove off, Malfoy.
HARRY: How did he find out?
-Just forget it.
DUMBLEDORE: Our Care of
Magical Creatures teacher...
...has decided to retire...
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...
...that his place will be taken
by none other...
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
DUMBLEDORE:
Finally, on a more disquieting note...
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst l've been assured...
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...
...a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...
...to give them no reason
to harm you.
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know,
happiness can be found...
...even in the darkest of times...
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.
SEAMUS:
Fortuna Major.
SEAMUS: Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
-Fortuna Major.
-No, no. Wait, wait.
Watch this.
-Amazing. Just with my voice.
-Fortuna Major.
-Yes, all right. Go in.
-Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
-She can't even sing.
SEAMUS: Exactly.
HARRY: Hey, man.
SEAMUS: Hey, man.
BEM: Oh, God.
HERMlONE: That's awful.
RON:
Green. That's a monkey.
RON: What is that?
DEAN: You call that a monkey?
RON:
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
SEAMUS: Ron, catch.
RON: l will.
SEAMUS:
I think we have a winner.
-Oh, don't try one of them.
SEAMUS: Oh, no.
RON:
Look at him. His face.
WOMAN:
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden
your minds.
-First, you must look beyond.
-What a load of rubbish.
-Where did you come from?
-Me?
-l've been here all this time.
-You, boy....
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
-l think you are.
-Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah. Um, well....
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.
So...
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
TRELAWNEY:
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear...
...you have the Grim.
SEAMUS:
The Grin? What's the Grin?
BEM:
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.
It's an omen...
...of death."
RON: You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?
HERMlONE: Honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?
HERMlONE:
A fair few.
Hang on. That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.
You have to be in two
classes at once.
HERMlONE: Don't be silly. How could
anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson. So follow me.
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
DRACO: Don't be such a wimp.
-l'm okay. Okay.
-l think they're funny.
DRACO: Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Ooh....
Dementor! Dementor!
HERMlONE: Just ignore him.
RON: You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Tah-tah-dah-dah!
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
HAGRID:
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Come on now.
Now...
...you have to let him make the first
move. lt's only polite. So...
...step up. Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not-- Well,
we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry. Back off.
Keep still.
Oh, well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.
Go on. Don't be shy.
GIRL:
Ow!
HAGRID: Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry. That's it....
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly....
That's it....
Yes!
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!
BEM:
Does he get to fly?
HAGRID: He may let you ride him now.
-What?
-Come on.
HARRY: Hey, hey, hey!
HAGRID: Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.
HARRY:
Whoa!
Ha! Whoo-hoo!
[STUDENTS CHATTERlNG
AND CLAPPlNG]
HAGRID: Well done, Harry,
and well done, Buckbeak.
HERMlONE:
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
HAGRID:
Well done, well done.
-How am l doing me first day?
-Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no....
HAGRID: No!
-Ow!
HAGRID:
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa....
Whoa! Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature....
-lt's killed me! lt's killed me!
-Calm down. It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
-He has to be taken to the hospital.
-l'm the teacher. l'll do it.
DRACO: You're gonna regret this.
-Class dismissed!
DRACO:
You and your bloody chicken!
GIRL:
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
DRACO: lt comes and it goes.
Still, l consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and l could've lost my arm.
-l can't do homework for weeks.
-Listen to the idiot.
-He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
-At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
SEAMUS: He's been sighted!
RON: Who?
Sirius Black!
HERMlONE:
Dufftown? That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?
BOY: With dementors at every entrance?
-Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.
LUPlN:
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...
...as to what is inside?
-That's a boggart, that is.
-Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?
HERMlONE: No one knows.
-When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.
-That's what makes them so--
-So terrifying, yes, yes, yes....
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me. Riddikulus!
STUDENTS: Riddikulus!
LUPlN: Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
-Riddikulus!
-Riddikulus!
-This class is ridiculous.
LUPlN: Very good.
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.
Come on.
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?
Professor Snape.
-Sorry?
-Professor Snape.
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.
-You live with your grandmother.
-l don't want it to turn into her, either.
No...
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.
-She carries a red handbag--
-We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when l open that wardrobe...
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes. Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
NEVILLE:
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line....
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...
...and turn it into something funny.
Next! Ron!
LUPlN: Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes! You see? Very good, very good!
Marvelous! Absolutely, very,
very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!
Show us what you see.
LUPlN:
Keep your nerve. Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next! Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it,
then l could--
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys. See you later.
Professor, can l ask you something?
LUPlN: You want to know why l stopped
you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.
HARRY:
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then l remembered that night
on the train...
-...and the dementor.
-l'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted...
...l heard something.
A woman...
...screaming.
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother...
...the night she was murdered.
The very first time l saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I knew her.
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James,
on the other hand...
...he....
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.
RON: Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.
-You heard it's the most--
HARRY: Haunted building in Britain.
What's going on?
RON: Probably Neville forgot
the password again.
-Hey.
RON: Oh, you're there.
PERCY: Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady! She's gone!
RON: Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
HERMlONE:
It's not funny, Ron.
PERCY:
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
PERCY: Be quiet. The headmaster's here.
FILCH: Come on, move.
PERCY:
You heard. Move!
DUMBLEDORE:
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
PERCY:
Mind where you're going! Slow down!
You listen! l'm Head Boy!
-Come back here!
DUMBLEDORE: Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
FILCH: l searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.
DUMBLEDORE: Thank you.
WlZARD TEACHER: The floor's clear.
DUMBLEDORE: Good.
SNAPE: I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.
DUMBLEDORE:
I didn't really expect him to linger.
SNAPE:
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...
-...completely undetected?
DUMBLEDORE: Quite remarkable.
SNAPE:
Any theories on how he managed it?
DUMBLEDORE:
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
SNAPE:
You may recall...
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...
...about your appointment
of Professor--
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...
...and l'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.
SNAPE: What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
DUMBLEDORE:
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.
-We're not meant to start that for weeks.
-Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
SNAPE: Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?
No one?
-How disappointing.
HERMlONE: Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon...
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...
...or do you take pride in being
an insufferable know-it-all?
-He's got a point, you know.
-Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...
-...on recognizing it.
-lt's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then l suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf"...
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...
...being bitten by a werewolf....
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!
DUMBLEDORE:
Aresto momentum!
RON: He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
FRED: Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 1 00 feet.
GEORGE: Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.
HARRY: Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.
-How are you feeling?
-Oh, brilliant.
GEORGE:
You gave us a right good scare.
HARRY: What happened?
RON: Well, you fell off your broom.
Really? l meant the match. Who won?
Um, no one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you,
he sent them off.
There's something else
you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and....
Well....
LUPlN: I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
HARRY:
No.
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?
-l mean, more than everyone else?
-Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
-l'm scared, professor.
-l'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one
on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
-But you made it go away.
-l don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
MAN: Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
HARRY: Guys, let me go.
FRED: Clever, Harry.
GEORGE: But not clever enough.
FRED: We've got a better way.
HARRY: l'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
FRED & GEORGE: We know.
FRED:
We'll get you there.
GEORGE: We'll show you a quicker way.
FRED: If you pipe down.
-Bless him.
HARRY: Let me go! Come on. Don't--
FRED: Now, Harry.
GEORGE: Come and join the big boys.
-What are you doing?!
FRED: Shh!
-What's this rubbish?
-"What's this rubbish?" he says.
-lt's the secret to our success.
-lt's a wrench giving it to you--
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
HARRY: Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that--
-No. Is that really--?
-Dumbledore.
-ln his study.
-Pacing.
GEORGE:
Does that a lot.
HARRY:
So this map shows--
FRED: Everyone.
-Everyone?
-Where they are.
-What they do.
-Every minute.
-Every day.
-Brilliant! Where did you get it?
-From Filch's office.
-First year.
-There are seven secret passageways...
-...out of the castle.
-We'd recommend this one.
-The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
GEORGE: Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
BOY:
Delicious.
HERMlONE: lt's meant to be
the most haunted building in Britain.
-Did l mention that?
RON: Twice.
-Oh. Do you want to move a bit closer?
-Huh?
-To the Shrieking Shack?
-Oh. Actually, I'm fine here.
DRACO:
Well, well. Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new
dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
-Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
-Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
-Hope you don't mean yourself.
-How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
-Don't stand there! Do something!
-What?
RON:
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
DRACO:
Get out of the way!
Move!
CRABBE:
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.
HERMlONE: He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
Aren't you?
RON:
Sure. Along with his lnvisibility Cloak.
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
-Ron fancies her.
RON: That's not true!
FUDGE: McGonagall!
MCGONAGALL: Cornelius!
HAGRID:
Allow me, minister.
FUDGE: Oh, Hagrid....
HAGRID: Sorry.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...
-...into my pub every other night!
FUDGE: We have....
-We have a killer on the loose.
ROSMERTA: Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
FUDGE: Harry Potter.
-Harry Potter?
-Shh!
FUDGE: Come.
HERMlONE:
Harry!
-No underage wizards allowed in today!
-Shut the damn door!
-So rude.
-Thick heads.
SHRUNKEN HEAD 1 : Thick?!
SHRUNKEN HEAD 2: How dare they!
-Who are they calling that?
SHRUNKEN HEAD 1 : Whippersnappers!
ROSMERTA: Nobody will come to a pub
where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death--
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
ROSMERTA: Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.
-Trailing after Black.
ROSMERTA: l remember.
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.
-What happened?
MCGONAGALL: He tried to warn them...
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...
-...but he's the reason they're dead.
-He wants to finish things.
ROSMERTA: l don't believe it.
FUDGE: That's not the worst.
ROSMERTA: What could be worse?
-This: Sirius Black was...
...and remains to this day...
...Harry Potter's godfather!
HERMlONE:
Ron, look!
HERMlONE: Excuse me, excuse me.
RON: Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend...
...and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, l'm gonna kill him!
LUPlN:
Harry.
There you are. You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.
HARRY:
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell l'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No? Well....
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.
-Expecto Patronum.
-Very good.
Shall we? Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto.... Expecto....
Expect....
LUPlN: Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.
It's all right. l didn't expect you
to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
-That's one nasty dementor.
-Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?
-Which memory did you choose?
-The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt...
-...but it's complicated.
-ls it strong?
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
LUPlN:
Yes!
Well done, Harry. Well done!
HARRY: l think l've had enough for today.
-Yes. Sit down. Here.
Eat this, it helps. lt really helps.
And just so you know, Harry...
...l think you'd have given your father
a run for his money.
And that is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory l chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
-Beautiful day.
-Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
-Ronald has lost his rat.
-l haven't lost anything!
-Your cat killed him!
-Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
HERMlONE: Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!
RON: Your cat killed him!
HERMlONE: Did not.
RON: Did.
HERMlONE: Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...
...talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.
HERMlONE:
And then?
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.
RON: They're not sacking you!
HAGRID: No, l'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders! There's-- There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
-l don't wanna tap-dance!
-Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah. Tell them. l'll tell them....
ROSMERTA: Peter Pettigrew?
MCGONAGALL: Lump of a boy.
-Always trailing after Sirius Black.
FUDGE: Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!
-Put that light out!
-Sorry.
-Watch it there, boy.
-We're trying to sleep here!
SLEEPlNG PORTRAlT:
Yes, we are.
Mischief managed. Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it
if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
-Spare bit of parchment.
-Really? Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and...."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."
-You insolent little--
-Professor!
Well, well. Lupin.
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
SNAPE:
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
-Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
-l seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.
Are you deaf? Put that light out!
LUPlN:
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...
...but quite frankly, l am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...
...is a map to you?
-No.
-No, sir.
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, l will not cover up for you again.
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
HARRY: Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone l know to be dead.
LUPlN:
Oh, really? And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what l saw.
Good night, professor.
TRELAWNEY: Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the lnner Eye.
TRELAWNEY:
Only then can you see. Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
-Oh. Do you mind me trying?
-Ah....
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...
...l sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...
...to which you so desperately cleave.
Have l said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.
Hang on.
-We better take this back.
-l'm not going back.
-Fine. See you later.
-See you.
Harry Potter....
-Professor Trelawney--
VOICES: He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...
...shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt...
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.
Oh, l'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
HERMlONE: l can't believe they're going
to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
-lt just got worse.
DRACO: What did l say? Father said...
...l can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
GOYLE: Look who's here.
-Come to see the show?
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
-Oh!
GOYLE: Malfoy, are you okay?
-Let's go. Quick.
DRACO: Not a word to anyone.
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me
when they....
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
-We'll stay with you too.
-You'll do no such thing!
Think l want you seeing
something like that? No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron....
Scabbers! You're alive!
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-l think you owe someone an apology.
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.
I meant me!
HAGRID:
Blimey. What was that?
Ow!
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
DUMBLEDORE:
No, minister. Over this way.
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick. Quick!
Hagrid.
-lt'll be fine. It'll be okay.
-Go on, go on!
DUMBLEDORE:
That's ling you see there--
-On the slope-- Ah, Hagrid.
HAGRID: Professor Dumbledore.
DUMBLEDORE: Good evening.
HAGRID: Make your way through.
-Have a tea, if you like.
FUDGE: No, Hagrid.
HAGRID: Gentlemen.
DUMBLEDORE: I'd like a cup of tea.
FUDGE: Well, I think we should
get down to our business, shall we?
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.
HAGRID: Dear, dear....
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid. Now, come on.
All right. lt'll be all right.
FUDGE: The execution shall dispatch--
HARRY: What?
I thought I just saw--
-Never mind.
-Let's go!
HAGRID:
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me. Scabbers.
Ron. Ron!
HARRY: Ron!
RON: Scabbers, come back.
HARRY:
Wait!
RON: Scabbers, you bit me!
-Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good. Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
RON:
It's the Grim!
-Ah! Harry!
-Ron! Ron, wait!
-Ron!
-Harry!
-Help!
HARRY: Ron!
Ah!
HARRY: Ron. Ron.
HERMlONE: Ron!
HARRY:
Come on!
Move!
HERMlONE:
Duck!
HERMlONE:
Harry!
HERMlONE: Oh, I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.
-Where do you suppose this goes?
-l have a hunch.
I just hope l'm wrong.
HERMlONE: We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?
HARRY:
Come on.
Ron.
HERMlONE: Ron. You're okay.
-The dog. Where is it?
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!
No. Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
-Expelliarmus!
HARRY: Ah!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?
-l found him.
LUPlN: I know.
-lt's him.
-l understand.
-Let's kill him!
-No! I trusted you!
And all this time,
you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
-Since Professor Snape set the essay.
LUPlN: Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch
of your age l've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
-Wait!
-l did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
LUPlN:
Very well. Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
HARRY:
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
-You're the reason they're dead!
-No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents...
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!
-Who was it, then?
-Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room! Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
-Come out, come out and play!
-Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped l'd be the one
to catch you.
LUPlN:
Severus--
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and l have business...
-...to attend to.
-Give me a reason. I beg you!
-Don't be a fool.
-He can't help it. It's habit.
-Be quiet.
-Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but l'll do my best.
LUPlN:
Severus, please.
After you.
HARRY:
Expelliarmus!
-Harry! What did you just do?
-You attacked a teacher!
-Tell me about Peter.
-He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
-No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
-No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!
-The map was lying, then.
-The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
-Me?! He's mental!
-Not you! Your rat!
-Scabbers has been in my family for--
-Twelve years?
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!
-He's missing a toe, isn't he?
RON: So what?
-All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
BLACK: Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!
-And then he transformed into a rat!
-Show me.
-Give it to him, Ron.
-What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?
Ah!
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
-James. We were the best of friends--
-How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!
-You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
-l didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
-What would you have done?
-Died, rather than betray my friends!
PETTlGREW: James wouldn't have
wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
BLACK: Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!
No!
-Harry, this man--
-l know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
-Bless you, boy. Bless you!
-Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that,
the dementors can have you.
BLACK: Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
RON: A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
BLACK:
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.
The tail l could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
HARRY:
Okay.
Okay.
RON: You better go.
HARRY: No. Don't worry, okay?
It's fine. I'll stay.
You go, l'll stay.
HARRY: You okay?
-l'm fine. Go.
HERMlONE: That looks really painful.
-So painful.
They might chop it.
HERMlONE: l'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.
RON: lt's too late. lt's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
BLACK:
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.
That was a noble thing
you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...
...to become killers.
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
PETTlGREW: Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
-Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't--
LUPlN: Get away from her!
BLACK:
I don't know if you know, Harry...
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...
...but if you ever wanted
a different home....
What? Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
HERMlONE:
Harry!
BLACK: Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
BLACK:
Remus! Remus!
BLACK:
Run! Run!
HARRY: Come on.
-Wait. Wait.
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
RON:
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
SNAPE:
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No. Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
HERMlONE:
Harry?
I saw my dad.
HERMlONE:
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.
-They're gonna kill him?
-No. It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
-They've got the wrong man.
-lt's true. Sirius is innocent.
-lt's Scabbers who did it.
-Scabbers?
RON:
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
-But then they gave him an owl--
-The point is, we know the truth.
-Please believe us.
-l do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 1 3-year-old
wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice,
however honest and true...
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful...
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell
of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, l feel,
to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight...
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, l find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell
was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk....
What just happened?
-Where's Ron?
HERMlONE: 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Come on. And we can't be seen.
HARRY:
Hermione!
HARRY:
Hermione! Hermione, wait.
Will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?
DRACO:
Come to see the show?
HERMlONE: You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!
That's us.
RON:
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how l've been getting
to my lessons all year.
-You mean we've gone back in time?
-Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
GOYLE: Run.
DRACO: Not a word to anyone.
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.
HERMlONE: That felt good.
RON: Not good, brilliant.
HARRY:
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come. l'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.
RON:
Scabbers, you're alive!
HAGRID: Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-That's Pettigrew.
-Harry, you can't.
-He betrayed my parents.
-You don't expect me to sit here.
-Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
Ow!
Ow. That hurt.
Sorry.
DUMBLEDORE: That's ling
you see there-- Ah, Hagrid.
HERMlONE:
We're coming out the back door. Go!
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?
HARRY:
What?
HERMlONE:
I thought I just saw....
-Never mind.
RON: Let's go.
HERMlONE:
Okay, go, Harry. Go!
HARRY:
Get away. Get off.
Ow!
DUMBLEDORE: Minister, l really think
I should sign as well.
FUDGE:
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be....
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
FUDGE: Your name only.
DUMBLEDORE: It's a very long name....
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
-Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
DUMBLEDORE: Here, minister. Follow me.
-Now, look there.
FUDGE: Where?
DUMBLEDORE: Look beyond the rocks.
FUDGE: What am l supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.
-Oh, yes. lndeed, indeed.
-And all the strawberries.
-Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
FUDGE: l see no strawberries.
DUMBLEDORE: There.
FUDGE: Where?
DUMBLEDORE: There.
HARRY: This way.
FUDGE: Let's get this over, please.
DUMBLEDORE: All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
-Not a moment ago!
DUMBLEDORE: How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
FUDGE: Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
-Hagrid?
-Buckbeak.
DUMBLEDORE: I don't think he suggests
you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
HAGRID: Right.
-Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.
Thank you.
HAGRID: You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.
HERMlONE: Come on.
HARRY: This way.
HARRY:
This way, now.
-Now what?
-We save Sirius.
HARRY: How?
-No idea.
-Look. It's Lupin.
LUPlN: Immobulus!
HERMlONE:
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
HARRY:
Ah!
HERMlONE:
At least someone's enjoying himself.
HARRY:
Yeah.
-Hermione?
-Yeah?
Before, down by the lake,
when l was with Sirius...
...l did see someone.
That someone
made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him...
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
-Harry, but your dad's--
-Dead. l know.
I'm just telling you what l saw.
Here we come.
HARRY: You see Sirius talking to me?
HERMlONE: Uh-huh.
HARRY: He's asking me to live with him.
-That's great.
When we free him, l'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country...
...someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.
HERMlONE:
Harry!
BLACK:
Run!
Let's go.
-What are you doing?
-Saving your life.
HARRY:
Thanks.
-Great. Now he's coming for us.
-Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!
HERMlONE:
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.
Sirius. Come on!
-This is horrible.
-Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there. You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
HARRY: Sirius.
HERMlONE: You're dying...
...both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.
I knew l could do it
this time because...
...well, l had already done it.
-Does that make sense?
-No.
But l don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
BLACK:
I'll be forever grateful for this...
...to both of you.
-l want to go with you.
-One day, perhaps.
For some time,
my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides...
-...you're meant to be here.
-But you're innocent.
BLACK:
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this...
...but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
-You have--
-My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us
never really leave us.
And you can always find them...
...in here.
You really are the brightest witch
of your age.
We have to go.
-Well?
-He's free. We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
-What's he talking about, Harry?
-l don't know.
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?
LUPlN:
Hello, Harry.
LUPlN:
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
-You've been sacked.
-No.
No. I resigned, actually.
Resigned? Why?
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.
-But Dumbledore--
-He has already...
...risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are....
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
-Pettigrew escaped.
-Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If l am proud of anything...
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.
Now, since l am no longer
your teacher...
...l feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.
So now l'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then...
...mischief managed.
RON: Stand back, I said! Or l'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.
NEVILLE:
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can l have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
HARRY: What are you talking about?
-Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
GEORGE: lt's a Firebolt.
FRED: It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
-But who sent it?
-No one knows.
This came with it.
STUDENT 1 : Go!
STUDENT 2: Let's see.
HERMlONE:
How fast is it, Harry?
HARRY:
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.
HARRY:
Mischief managed.
Nox.
I don't know
about you, it's too hot today, isn't it?
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
Come on, guys, time to go home.
Come on, love, off you get.
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?
Hey, Big D.
Beat up another 10-year-old?
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
"Don't kill Cedric."
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."
Where is your mum?
Where is your mum, Potter?
She dead?
Is she dead?
Is she a dead Pott--?
Whoa.
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.
Dudley, run.
Expecto Patronum.
Mrs. Figg.
Don't put away your wand, Harry.
They might come back.
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know--?
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?
Uh-huh.
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.
Now, get inside and stay there.
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
There's sweat. There's stifling.
Diddykins?
Is that you?
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.
Who did this to you, boy?
Happy, are we, now? Eh?
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.
Vernon, don't say that.
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.
I've reached my limit, do you hear?
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.
As a clear violation...
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...
...you are hereby expelled...
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
Justice.
He's not very well.
Sorry, Hedwig.
Very clean, these Muggles.
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.
Professor Moody.
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.
- But the letter said--
- Dumbledore persuaded the minister...
...to suspend your expulsion,
pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?
- Uh-huh.
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.
Shh! Not here, Nymphadora.
Don't call me Nymphadora.
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.
Come on, you, around the corner.
Come on.
In you go, son.
There've been no sightings.
No deaths. No proof.
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...
Yes, but guarding
you-know-what is the most important...
We must trust Dumbledore on this.
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say
it's time to take action.
Ooh!
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.
- His instinct would be to ignore it--
- Shh. Keep your voices down.
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
Heavens, you're all right.
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.
Yeah.
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...
...what would she say to old Kreacher?
Oh, the shame.
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.
Kreacher is here.
Oh, Harry.
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.
So, what is this place?
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.
It's a secret society.
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.
- Only...
- Only what?
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.
Dumbledore said that?
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
Don't bottle it up,
though, mate. Let it out.
If you're all done shouting...
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry, we wouldn't
even know Voldemort was back.
He's not a child, Molly.
But he's not an adult either.
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.
He's as good as.
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon,
just like his godfather.
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.
--about your supposed reformation.
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?
- Get off it.
- Quick.
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
Oh!
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.
Hi, Mum.
You hungry, Harry?
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.
Harry Potter.
Sirius.
Ohh.
This is very, very peculiar.
It seems your hearing at the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.
Why?
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
No one in their right mind
could believe that--
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.
It's been twisted and warped by fear.
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.
The last time Voldemort gained power...
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.
We believe...
...Voldemort may be after something.
Sirius.
Something he didn't have last time.
You mean like a weapon?
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.
Harry.
You are hereby expelled.
Before the entire Wizengamot.
Trains. Underground.
Ingenious, these Muggles.
Ahh.
Here we are.
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.
Interdepartmental memos.
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
- They changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?
In five minutes.
Department of Mysteries.
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.
Yes, but we must be--
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
As the Muggles say, truth will out.
- Yes?
- Mm.
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
Good luck, Harry.
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag--
Witness for the defense.
Albus Percival Wulfric...
...Brian Dumbledore.
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...
-...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.
But by a happy mistake,
I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.
The charges?
The charges against the accused
are as follows:
"That he did knowingly...
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...
...produce a Patronus Charm...
...in the presence of a Muggle."
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but--
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...
-...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but--
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot--
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.
Dementors?
In Little Whinging?
That's quite clever.
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't--
- Enough.
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event--
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.
Please describe the attack.
What did they look like?
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.
Not the boys. The Dementors.
Oh, right, right. Well, um, big.
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.
I don't think anyone would believe...
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.
Dementors are, after all, under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.
And it's so silly of me,
but it sounded for a moment as though...
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.
Of course, there is someone...
...who might be behind the attack.
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.
He is not back.
In the matter of Harry Potter...
...the law clearly states...
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?
Those in favor of conviction?
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?
Cleared of all charges.
Professor.
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
You'll blow the entire operation.
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...
I had to see you off, didn't I?
What's life without a little risk?
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.
Oh, don't worry about me.
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.
Original Order of the Phoenix.
Marlene McKinnon.
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Neville's parents.
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.
It's been 14 years.
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?
It feels like it did before.
You keep it.
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.
I'll see you at the train.
Bye-bye, darling.
I love you.
Hold my hand, lovey.
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.
Bye.
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.
Better enjoy it while you can.
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!
It's only Malfoy.
What'd you expect?
Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.
What is it?
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
It's pulling itself, like always.
You're not going mad.
I can see them too.
You're just as sane as I am.
Everyone, this is Loony Love--
Luna Lovegood.
What an interesting necklace.
It's a charm, actually.
Keeps away the Nargles.
Hungry.
I hope there's pudding.
What's a Nargle?
No idea.
Good evening, children.
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you--
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.
And how lovely to see all your bright...
...happy faces smiling up at me.
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.
- That's likely.
- That's likely.
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.
Although each headmaster...
...has brought something new
to this historic school...
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...
...perfect what can be perfected...
...and prune practices
that ought to be...
...prohibited.
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.
Dean, Seamus.
- Good holiday?
- All right.
Better than Seamus', anyway.
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.
- Why not?
- Let me see. Uh, because of you.
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.
What, your mum believes them?
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll go at anyone that calls me a liar.
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.
Do you believe the rubbish he's come out
with about You-Know-Who?
Yeah. I do.
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?
- You all right?
- Fine.
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.
Harry.
Bring it over here. Over here.
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
Good morning, children.
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.
O-W-Ls.
More commonly known as OWLs.
Study hard and you will be rewarded.
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...
...course of defensive magic. Yes?
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?
Using spells? Ha-ha!
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.
We're not gonna use magic?
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.
Students will raise their
hands when they speak in my class.
It is the view of the Ministry...
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...
...to get you through your examinations...
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?
There is nothing out there, dear.
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
Now, let me make this quite plain.
You have been told...
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
Detention, Mr. Potter.
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.
Enough!
Enough.
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
Come in.
Good evening, Mr. Potter.
Sit.
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.
No, not with your quill.
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.
Now...
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."
How many times?
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.
You haven't given me any ink.
Oh, you won't need any ink.
Yes?
- Nothing.
- That's right.
Because you know, deep down...
...you deserve to be punished.
Don't you, Mr. Potter?
Go on.
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.
Get out of class whenever you like.
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.
Care for another?
I'm not asking you
to write all of it for me.
Oh, please.
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.
I'll do the introduction. That's all.
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.
What's wrong with your hand?
Nothing.
The other hand.
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
Harry, you've got to report this.
- It's perfectly simple. You're being--
- No, it's not.
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.
You don't understand.
Then help us to.
Dear Padfoot...
...I hope you're all right.
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.
I know you, of all people,
will understand.
Hello, Harry Potter.
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...
Different.
But why can't the others see them?
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.
So you've known someone
who's died, then?
My mum.
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.
Yes, it was rather horrible.
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.
We both believe you, by the way.
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.
I don't think that's true.
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.
What do you mean?
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...
...because if it's just you alone...
...you're not as much of a threat.
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.
Harry.
Can I join you?
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?
McGONAGALL: I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.
So silly of me, but it sounds...
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...
...Minerva.
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.
I am sorry, dear.
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...
...and by extension, the minister himself.
I am a tolerant woman...
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.
Disloyalty.
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.
What's happened to Dumbledore?
Having already revolutionized...
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Ans...
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.
Just one question, dear.
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
Yes.
But you were unsuccessful?
Obviously.
Could you please predict something
for me?
I'm sorry?
Move those mouths.
One teensy little prophecy?
Pity.
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.
Yes, I do. Something dark.
You are in grave danger.
Lovely.
Cho. What's going on?
It's Professor Trelawney.
Ooh!
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
Hogwarts is my home.
You can't do this.
Actually, I can.
Something you'd like to say?
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.
There... Shh. Shh.
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?
Sybil, dear. This way.
Thank you.
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister--
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.
That power remains with the headmaster.
For now.
Don't you all have studying to do?
Professor.
Professor?
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!
Professor Dumbledore.
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.
We're not learning how
to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how
to pass our OWLs.
She's taking over the entire school.
Security has been
and will remain the Ministry's top priority.
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...
...that these disappearances
are the work...
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.
Harry.
Sirius.
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?
Training you to kill half-breeds?
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.
Combat?
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?
That's exactly what he thinks.
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.
Voldemort is on the move.
Well, what can we do?
Someone's coming.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.
He really is out there, isn't he?
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.
Harry.
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?
I'm a nutter, remember?
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
Just a couple of people.
Lovely spot.
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.
Matey, come back here.
Um...
Hi.
So you all know why we're here.
We need a teacher.
A proper teacher.
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.
- Why?
- Why?
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.
So Dumbledore says because he says.
The point is, where's the proof?
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.
Come on, Hermione.
They're here because they think
I'm some sort of freak.
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?
Yes.
I've seen it.
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.
It's true.
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.
Wait.
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.
But out there...
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...
You don't know what that's like.
You're right, Harry, we don't.
That's why we need your help.
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...
...Voldemort...
He's really back?
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...
...where Umbridge won't find out.
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?
Who cares?
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.
What's that?
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.
Will do, Harry.
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.
The what?
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.
So say you really needed the toilet...
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
Whoa!
I'm hopeless.
You're just flourishing your wand
too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
You will please copy
the approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.
It's a Wizard's bread and butter, really.
So, um, come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well clone.
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.
- One Sickle.
- You're on.
Stupefy-
- Thank you.
- Shut up.
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?
It was completely intentional.
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.
Expelliarmus.
Very good. Keep your concentration.
Great.
A little higher.
Whoa!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
Those wishing to join
the inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.
Diminuendo.
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:
Believing in yourself.
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.
Think of it this way.
Every great wizard in history
has started out...
...as nothing more
than what we are now: students.
If they can do it, why not us?
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.
CHO".
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
So that's it for this lesson.
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.
Well done, mate.
Thanks.
See you after Christmas.
See you in the Common Room, Harry.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.
Merry Christmas.
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils--
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
Anyway, it's worth it.
It's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
He was really good.
It's just, Voldemort was better.
You're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able
to stun anything before.
Mistletoe.
Probably full of Nargles, though.
What are Nargles?
No idea.
RON".
Well, how was it?
Wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
That bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry.
Voldemort may be after something.
Something he didn't have last time.
Harry.
Harry.
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
Neither. It was like l....
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
Make sure he's found
by the right people.
- Sir.
- Phineas.
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.
They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he'll make it.
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to--
Look at me!
What's happening to me?
You wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
It appears there's a connection...
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.
Pray he remains ignorant.
You mean, if he knows about it, then...
-...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you
from access or influence.
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.
You will attempt to resist.
Prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
Here we go.
Daddy's back. Oh.
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And, um...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
There you are.
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.
To Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
- Harry.
- Harry.
Harry.
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
No more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!
Of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.
Sorry about that.
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.
Not to me, anyway.
What, you grew up here?
This is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.
This is the Black family tree.
My deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
My parents with their pure-blood mania.
My mother did that after I ran away.
Charming woman.
I was 16.
Where did you go?
Round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
You are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment
when I wanted to--
This connection
between me and Voldemort.
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.
You're not a bad person.
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.
You understand?
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.
That's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.
You'll see.
Come on.
Really?
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.
I told you. I've been away for me health.
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.
This is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.
- Giants?
- Shh.
You found them?
Well, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.
And they did this to you?
Not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.
It's changing out there.
Just like last time.
There's a storm coming, Harry.
We'd all best be ready when she does.
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.
We strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.
Harry.
I, uh...
I wanted to apologize.
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.
Neville?
Fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
She tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
But I'm not sure
I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.
Wow, that was really good.
Fantastic, Ginny.
Remember, your Patronus can only protect
you for as long as you stay focused.
So focus, Luna.
Think of the happiest thing you can.
Expecto Patronum.
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
Get them.
Been watching them for weeks.
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
We saw your lies for what they were:
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.
Naturally.
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
If we hurry,
we should still make the morning edition.
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.
Ah. I thought we might hit
this little snag.
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to--
What was the phrase?
--Come quietly.
Well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
Enough of this.
Take him.
Whoa.
Well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
Boys and girls cannot be
within eight inches of each other.
Those wishing to join
the inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.
Harry.
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?
To go it alone.
Psst.
Hagrid.
Any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
Down here, you great buffoon.
Oh, Grawpy.
Brought you some company.
I couldn't just leave him, because--
Because he's my brother.
Blimey.
Well, half brother, really.
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?
That's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
Put me down.
Now.
You all right?
Fine.
Just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
You just stay away from her, all right?
He gets his own food and all.
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.
You will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
Feeling sentimental?
- That's private.
- Not to me.
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.
You're just like your father.
Lazy, arrogant.
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.
Control your emotions.
Discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I may vomit.
Stop it.
Is this what you call control?
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.
The Dark Lord isn't resting.
You and Black, you're two of a kind.
Sentimental children forever whining...
...about how bitterly unfair
your lives have been.
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.
- Legilimens.
- Protego.
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
Nice one, James.
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Enough.
Enough.
Your lessons are at an end.
I--
Get out.
- What's your name?
- Michael.
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
It's fading already.
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.
You know, George...
...I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.
All right, professor!
Here you go.
Aah!
Ready when you are.
I need that prophecy.
You'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.
- Crucio.
- Aah!
- Crucio.
- Aah!
Sirius.
Harry, are you sure?
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
It's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.
What do we do?
We'll have to use the Floo Network.
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.
Not all of them.
Alohomora.
Alert the Order if you can.
Are you mental? We're going with you.
It's too dangerous.
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.
That you are.
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?
- No.
- Liar.
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.
Have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.
The last of it on Miss Chang.
Unless you wish to poison him--
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.
--I cannot help you.
He's got Padfoot.
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?
What is he talking about, Snape?
No idea.
Very well.
You give me no choice, Potter.
As this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.
That's illegal.
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.
Tell her, Harry!
Tell me what?
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I Will.
Where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon .
How much further?
Not far.
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.
What are you doing?
improvising.
Well?
Where is this weapon?
There isn't one, is there?
You were trying to trick me.
You know...
...I really hate children.
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.
Lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law,
as creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
How dare you?
Filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
Please. Please stop it. Please.
Now, enough. I will have order.
You filthy animal.
Do you know who I am?
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.
No, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
- But I must not tell lies.
- What are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.
Let me go!
Thank you, Grawp.
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.
That was clever, Ron.
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.
So how are we getting to London?
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.
Or was that all just words to you?
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.
So how are we going to get to London?
We fly, of course.
Department of Mysteries.
This is it.
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.
Ninety-four.
Ninety-five.
- He should be here.
- Harry.
It's got your name on it.
The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.
For neither can live
while the other survives.
Harry.
Where's Sirius?
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.
Now, hand me the prophecy.
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.
He knows how to play.
Itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?
Better, now they're about to be avenged.
Now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
All we want is that prophecy.
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?
You dare speak his name?
You filthy half-blood!
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.
Which is lucky for you, really.
Haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?
Why he was unable to kill you...
...when you were just an infant?
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.
All you have to do...
...is give it to me.
Then I can show you everything.
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
Petrificus Totalus.
Well done, Neville.
Stupefy-
- Stupefy-
- Stupefy-
Stupefy-
Reducto.
Get back to the door.
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?
The voices.
Can you tell what they're saying?
There aren't any voices, Harry.
Let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
Please, Harry.
Get behind me.
Did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...
...that children stood a chance
against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
Give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
- Don't give it to him, Harry.
- Shh!
Get away from my godson.
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.
What? No, I'm staying with you.
You've done beautifully.
Now, let me take it from here.
Black.
Expelliarmus!
Nice one, James.
Avada Kedavra.
No. No.
I killed Sirius Black. Ha-ha-ha!
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.
You've got to mean it, Harry.
She killed him. She deserves it.
You know the spell, Harry.
Do it.
So weak.
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.
The Aurors are on their way.
By which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
You've lost, old man.
Harry.
Aah!
So weak.
So vulnerable.
Look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
It's how you are not.
Aah!
Harry?
You're the weak one...
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.
And I feel sorry for you.
You're a fool, Harry Potter.
And you will lose everything.
He's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
No, you don't.
It's my fault.
No, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...
...he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.
The prophecy said:
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."
It means one of us
is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.
The same reason your friends saved you.
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
How come you're not at the feast?
Lost all my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding them.
- That's awful.
- Oh, it's all good fun.
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.
Do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?
That's all right.
Anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.
If not always in the way we expect.
Think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.
What's that?
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.
Yeah?
Something worth fighting for.
WEATHERMAN : I don't know
about you, it's too hot today, isn't it?
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
WOMAN:
Come on, guys, time to go home.
Come on, love, off you get.
CHILD: Do we have to?
WOMAN: Yes, we do.
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.
MALCOLM:
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?
PIERS: Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?
HARRY:
Hey, Big D.
Beat up another 10-year-old?
- This one deserved it.
GANG: Yeah.
HARRY: Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
DUDLEY:
"Don't kill Cedric."
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
- Shut up.
DUDLEY: "He's going to kill me, Mum."
Where is your mum?
Where is your mum, Potter?
She dead?
Is she dead?
Is she a dead Pott--?
GANG:
Whoa.
BOY 1: Dudley.
BOY 2: Dudley, let's go.
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.
BOY 3: We're getting out of here, Dudley.
BOY 4:
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.
HARRY:
Dudley, run.
Expecto Patronum.
Mrs. Figg.
Don't put away your wand, Harry.
They might come back.
FIGG: Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know--?
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?
FIGG:
Uh-huh.
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.
Now, get inside and stay there.
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
WEATHERMAN:
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
There's sweat. There's stifling.
Diddykins?
Is that you?
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.
Who did this to you, boy?
Happy, are we, now? Eh?
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.
Vernon, don't say that.
VERNON: Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.
I've reached my limit, do you hear?
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.
- Dear Mr. Potter.
VERNON : What?
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.
As a clear violation...
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...
...you are hereby expelled...
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
Justice.
[DUDLEY WHIMPERING
AND MUTTERING]
He's not very well.
Sorry, Hedwig.
WOMAN :
Very clean, these Muggles.
MOODY: Tonks, for God's sake.
TONKS: Unnatural.
Professor Moody.
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.
- But the letter said--
- Dumbledore persuaded the minister...
...to suspend your expulsion,
pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?
SHACKLEBOLT: Uh-huh.
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.
Shh! Not here, Nymphadora.
Don't call me Nymphadora.
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.
MAN:
Come on, you, around the corner.
MOODY:
Come on.
In you go, son.
ARTHUR:
There've been no sightings.
No deaths. No proof.
SIRIUS: He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...
ARTHUR: Yes, but guarding
you-know-what is the most important...
ARTHUR:
We must trust Dumbledore on this.
SIRIUS:
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say
it's time to take action.
TONKS:
Ooh!
ARTHUR: Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.
- His instinct would be to ignore it--
MOLLY: Shh. Keep your voices down.
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
Heavens, you're all right.
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.
Yeah.
VOICE:
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...
...what would she say to old Kreacher?
Oh, the shame.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Freaks.
KREACHER: There, there, mistress.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.
KREACHER:
Kreacher is here.
Oh, Harry.
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.
So, what is this place?
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.
It's a secret society.
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.
- Only...
- Only what?
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.
Dumbledore said that?
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
FRED: Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
FRED: Don't bottle it up,
though, mate. Let it out.
If you're all done shouting...
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?
SIRIUS :
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry, we wouldn't
even know Voldemort was back.
He's not a child, Molly.
MOLLY:
But he's not an adult either.
- He's not James, Sirius.
SIRIUS: Well, he's not your son.
MOLLY:
He's as good as.
- Who else has he got?
HARRY: Hey, Ginny.
SIRIUS: He's got me.
SNAPE: How touchingly paternal, Black.
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon,
just like his godfather.
SIRIUS:
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.
SIRIUS:
--about your supposed reformation.
- I know better.
SNAPE: So why don't you tell him?
FRED: Get off it.
GEORGE: Quick.
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.
- Stop it.
FRED: Get off, you bloody cat.
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.
RON: Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
Oh!
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.
GINNY:
Hi, Mum.
You hungry, Harry?
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.
SIRIUS:
Harry Potter.
Sirius.
SIRIUS:
Ohh.
ARTHUR:
This is very, very peculiar.
It seems your hearing at the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.
SIRIUS:
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.
HARRY:
Why?
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
No one in their right mind
could believe that--
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.
It's been twisted and warped by fear.
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.
The last time Voldemort gained power...
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.
We believe...
...Voldemort may be after something.
Sirius.
Something he didn't have last time.
You mean like a weapon?
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.
VOLDEMORT:
Harry.
HOPKIRK:
You are hereby expelled.
ARTHUR:
Before the entire Wizengamot.
ARTHUR:
Trains. Underground.
Ingenious, these Muggles.
Ahh.
ARTHUR:
Here we are.
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.
MAN: Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.
Interdepartmental memos.
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
- They changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?
ARTHUR:
In five minutes.
WOMAN'S VOICE:
Department of Mysteries.
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.
Yes, but we must be--
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
As the Muggles say, truth will out.
- Yes?
- Mm.
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
Good luck, Harry.
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag--
DUMBLEDORE:
Witness for the defense.
Albus Percival Wulfric...
...Brian Dumbledore.
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...
-...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.
But by a happy mistake,
I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.
The charges?
The charges against the accused
are as follows:
"That he did knowingly...
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...
...produce a Patronus Charm...
...in the presence of a Muggle."
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but--
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...
-...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but--
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot--
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.
BONES:
Dementors?
In Little Whinging?
That's quite clever.
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't--
- Enough.
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event--
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.
BONES:
Please describe the attack.
What did they look like?
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.
Not the boys. The Dementors.
Oh, right, right. Well, um, big.
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.
DUMBLEDORE:
I don't think anyone would believe...
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.
Dementors are, after all, under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.
And it's so silly of me,
but it sounded for a moment as though...
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.
DUMBLEDORE: That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.
Of course, there is someone...
...who might be behind the attack.
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.
He is not back.
DUMBLEDORE:
In the matter of Harry Potter...
...the law clearly states...
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?
Those in favor of conviction?
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?
Cleared of all charges.
Professor.
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
You'll blow the entire operation.
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...
SIRIUS:
I had to see you off, didn't I?
What's life without a little risk?
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.
Oh, don't worry about me.
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.
Original Order of the Phoenix.
Marlene McKinnon.
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
Frank and Alice Longbottom.
HARRY:
Neville's parents.
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.
It's been 14 years.
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?
It feels like it did before.
You keep it.
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.
I'll see you at the train.
WOMAN 1:
Bye-bye, darling.
I love you.
WOMAN 2:
Hold my hand, lovey.
MAN: There they are.
They're in the far carriage.
Bye.
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.
Better enjoy it while you can.
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!
It's only Malfoy.
What'd you expect?
Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.
What is it?
RON: What's what?
HARRY: That. Pulling the carriage.
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
It's pulling itself, like always.
GIRL:
You're not going mad.
I can see them too.
You're just as sane as I am.
Everyone, this is Loony Love--
Luna Lovegood.
What an interesting necklace.
It's a charm, actually.
Keeps away the Nargles.
Hungry.
I hope there's pudding.
RON :
What's a Nargle?
HERMIONE :
No idea.
DUMBLEDORE:
Good evening, children.
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you--
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.
UMBRIDGE: Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.
And how lovely to see all your bright...
...happy faces smiling up at me.
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.
- That's likely.
- That's likely.
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.
Although each headmaster...
...has brought something new
to this historic school...
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...
...perfect what can be perfected...
...and prune practices
that ought to be...
...prohibited.
DUMBLEDORE:
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.
RON: Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?
DUMBLEDORE:
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.
HARRY:
Dean, Seamus.
- Good holiday?
DEAN: All right.
Better than Seamus', anyway.
SEAMUS: Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.
- Why not?
- Let me see. Uh, because of you.
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.
What, your mum believes them?
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll go at anyone that calls me a liar.
RON: What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.
Do you believe the rubbish he's come out
with about You-Know-Who?
Yeah. I do.
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?
- You all right?
- Fine.
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.
VOLDEMORT:
Harry.
[STUDENTS CHATTERING
AND LAUGHING]
GIRL:
Bring it over here. Over here.
BOY:
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
Good morning, children.
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.
O-W-Ls.
More commonly known as OWLs.
Study hard and you will be rewarded.
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...
...course of defensive magic. Yes?
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?
Using spells? Ha-ha!
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.
We're not gonna use magic?
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.
UMBRIDGE: Students will raise their
hands when they speak in my class.
It is the view of the Ministry...
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...
...to get you through your examinations...
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?
There is nothing out there, dear.
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
Now, let me make this quite plain.
You have been told...
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
UMBRIDGE:
Detention, Mr. Potter.
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.
Enough!
Enough.
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
UMBRIDGE:
Come in.
Good evening, Mr. Potter.
Sit.
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.
No, not with your quill.
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.
Now...
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."
How many times?
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.
You haven't given me any ink.
Oh, you won't need any ink.
Yes?
- Nothing.
- That's right.
Because you know, deep down...
...you deserve to be punished.
Don't you, Mr. Potter?
Go on.
FRED: Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.
Get out of class whenever you like.
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.
Care for another?
RON: I'm not asking you
to write all of it for me.
HERMIONE:
Oh, please.
RON: I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.
I'll do the introduction. That's all.
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.
What's wrong with your hand?
Nothing.
The other hand.
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
Harry, you've got to report this.
- It's perfectly simple. You're being--
- No, it's not.
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.
You don't understand.
Then help us to.
HARRY :
Dear Padfoot...
...I hope you're all right.
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.
I know you, of all people,
will understand.
Hello, Harry Potter.
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
HARRY: What are they?
LUNA: They're called Thestrals.
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...
Different.
But why can't the others see them?
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.
So you've known someone
who's died, then?
My mum.
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.
Yes, it was rather horrible.
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.
We both believe you, by the way.
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.
I don't think that's true.
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.
What do you mean?
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...
...because if it's just you alone...
...you're not as much of a threat.
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.
Harry.
Can I join you?
UMBRIDGE: Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?
McGONAGALL: I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.
UMBRIDGE:
So silly of me, but it sounds...
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...
...Minerva.
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.
I am sorry, dear.
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...
...and by extension, the minister himself.
I am a tolerant woman...
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.
Disloyalty.
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.
REPORTER:
What's happened to Dumbledore?
FUDGE: Having already revolutionized...
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Ans...
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.
Just one question, dear.
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
Yes.
But you were unsuccessful?
Obviously.
Could you please predict something
for me?
I'm sorry?
Move those mouths.
One teensy little prophecy?
Pity.
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.
Yes, I do. Something dark.
You are in grave danger.
Lovely.
Cho. What's going on?
It's Professor Trelawney.
TRELAWNEY:
Ooh!
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
Hogwarts is my home.
You can't do this.
Actually, I can.
Something you'd like to say?
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.
There... Shh. Shh.
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?
Sybil, dear. This way.
Thank you.
UMBRIDGE: Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister--
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.
That power remains with the headmaster.
For now.
DUMBLEDORE:
Don't you all have studying to do?
Professor.
Professor?
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!
Professor Dumbledore.
HERMIONE:
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.
We're not learning how
to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how
to pass our OWLs.
She's taking over the entire school.
FUDGE : Security has been
and will remain the Ministry's top priority.
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...
...that these disappearances
are the work...
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.
SIRIUS:
Harry.
Sirius.
- What are you doing here?
SIRIUS: Answering your letter.
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?
Training you to kill half-breeds?
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
SIRIUS: Well, I'm not surprised.
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.
RON:
Combat?
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?
That's exactly what he thinks.
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.
Voldemort is on the move.
Well, what can we do?
Someone's coming.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.
He really is out there, isn't he?
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.
VOLDEMORT:
Harry.
HARRY: This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?
I'm a nutter, remember?
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.
HARRY:
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
HERMIONE:
Just a couple of people.
Lovely spot.
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.
MAN:
Matey, come back here.
Um...
Hi.
So you all know why we're here.
We need a teacher.
A proper teacher.
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.
- Why?
RON: Why?
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.
- So he says.
HERMIONE: So Dumbledore says.
BOY:
So Dumbledore says because he says.
The point is, where's the proof?
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.
Come on, Hermione.
They're here because they think
I'm some sort of freak.
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?
HERMIONE:
Yes.
I've seen it.
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.
It's true.
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.
Wait.
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.
But out there...
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...
You don't know what that's like.
HERMIONE:
You're right, Harry, we don't.
That's why we need your help.
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...
...Voldemort...
He's really back?
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...
...where Umbridge won't find out.
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?
HERMIONE:
Who cares?
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.
HARRY:
What's that?
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?
HARRY: Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.
NEVILLE:
Will do, Harry.
UMBRIDGE: All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.
HERMIONE: You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.
RON:
The what?
HERMIONE: It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.
RON:
So say you really needed the toilet...
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
NIGEL:
Whoa!
NEVILLE:
I'm hopeless.
You're just flourishing your wand
too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
UMBRIDGE: You will please copy
the approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.
NEVILLE : Expelliarmus.
UMBRIDGE: Wands away.
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.
It's a Wizard's bread and butter, really.
So, um, come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
HARRY:
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well clone.
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
FRED: Come on, Ron.
GEORGE: Come on, Ron.
BOY 1: You can do it.
BOY 2: Come on, Ron.
- One Sickle.
- You're on.
Stupefy-
- Thank you.
- Shut up.
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?
It was completely intentional.
UMBRIDGE: Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.
Expelliarmus.
Very good. Keep your concentration.
Great.
A little higher.
Whoa!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
BOY: Stupefy.
GIRL: Stupefy.
UMBRIDGE: Those wishing to join
the inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.
NIGEL:
Diminuendo.
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:
Believing in yourself.
GIRL: Expelliarmus.
BOY: Levicorpus. Got it.
Think of it this way.
Every great wizard in history
has started out...
...as nothing more
than what we are now: students.
If they can do it, why not us?
NIGEL: Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.
CHO".
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
GIRL 1 : Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.
GIRL 2:
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
So that's it for this lesson.
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.
Well done, mate.
Thanks.
GIRL 1:
See you after Christmas.
See you in the Common Room, Harry.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.
HARRY:
Merry Christmas.
GIRL 2: Thank you so much.
HARRY: Not at all. Merry Christmas.
BOY: Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
LUNA: Have a good Christmas.
HARRY: Have a great Christmas, Luna.
FRED: We've been thinking.
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils--
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
Anyway, it's worth it.
It's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
He was really good.
It's just, Voldemort was better.
You're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able
to stun anything before.
Mistletoe.
Probably full of Nargles, though.
What are Nargles?
No idea.
RON".
Well, how was it?
Wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
That bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...
VOLDEMORT:
Harry.
SIRIUS:
Voldemort may be after something.
Something he didn't have last time.
VOLDEMORT:
Harry.
Harry.
DUMBLEDORE: In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
Neither. It was like l....
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?
DUMBLEDORE:
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
Make sure he's found
by the right people.
HARRY: Sir.
DUMBLEDORE: Phineas.
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.
EVERARD: They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he'll make it.
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to--
Look at me!
What's happening to me?
You wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
SNAPE:
It appears there's a connection...
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.
Pray he remains ignorant.
You mean, if he knows about it, then...
-...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you
from access or influence.
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.
You will attempt to resist.
Prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.
SANTA TOY:
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
MOLLY:
Here we go.
Daddy's back. Oh.
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.
ARTHUR: And a nice big box for Ron.
MOLLY: Big box for you. And, um...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
- I want to see your faces.
ARTHUR: Yes.
MOLLY: Try it on.
GINNY: Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
MOLLY: Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
There you are.
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.
MOLLY:
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
ARTHUR: Thank you.
MOLLY: Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
- Hermione.
ARTHUR: A Christmas toast.
To Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
- Harry.
WEASLEYS: Harry.
Harry.
ARTHUR: That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.
MOLLY:
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.
RON:
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
HERMIONE:
No more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.
- If my poor mistress only knew...
SIRIUS: Kreacher!
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!
Of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.
Sorry about that.
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.
Not to me, anyway.
What, you grew up here?
SIRIUS:
This is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.
This is the Black family tree.
My deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
My parents with their pure-blood mania.
My mother did that after I ran away.
Charming woman.
I was 16.
Where did you go?
Round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
You are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment
when I wanted to--
This connection
between me and Voldemort.
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.
You're not a bad person.
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.
You understand?
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.
That's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.
You'll see.
Come on.
Really?
HERMIONE:
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
UMBRIDGE:
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.
HAGRID:
I told you. I've been away for me health.
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.
This is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.
- Giants?
HAGRID: Shh.
You found them?
Well, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.
- Death Eaters?
HAGRID: Yes.
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.
And they did this to you?
Not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.
It's changing out there.
Just like last time.
There's a storm coming, Harry.
We'd all best be ready when she does.
FUDGE: We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.
We strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.
SEAMUS:
Harry.
I, uh...
I wanted to apologize.
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.
HARRY:
Neville?
Fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
She tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
But I'm not sure
I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.
Wow, that was really good.
Fantastic, Ginny.
Remember, your Patronus can only protect
you for as long as you stay focused.
So focus, Luna.
Think of the happiest thing you can.
NEVILLE:
Expecto Patronum.
- I'm trying.
HARRY: I know. It's good.
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
UMBRIDGE:
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
Get them.
UMBRIDGE:
Been watching them for weeks.
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
We saw your lies for what they were:
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.
Naturally.
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.
FUDGE:
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
If we hurry,
we should still make the morning edition.
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.
Ah. I thought we might hit
this little snag.
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to--
What was the phrase?
--Come quietly.
Well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
Enough of this.
Take him.
Whoa.
Well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
UMBRIDGE: Boys and girls cannot be
within eight inches of each other.
Those wishing to join
the inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.
CHO:
Harry.
RON: You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.
HERMIONE: Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?
To go it alone.
HAGRID:
Psst.
Hagrid.
RON:
Any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
HAGRID:
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
Down here, you great buffoon.
Oh, Grawpy.
Brought you some company.
HAGRID:
I couldn't just leave him, because--
Because he's my brother.
RON:
Blimey.
HAGRID:
Well, half brother, really.
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.
HAGRID: Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?
That's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
HERMIONE:
Grawp.
Put me down.
Now.
RON:
You all right?
Fine.
Just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
You just stay away from her, all right?
He gets his own food and all.
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.
You will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
Feeling sentimental?
- That's private.
- Not to me.
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.
You're just like your father.
Lazy, arrogant.
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.
Control your emotions.
Discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
VOLDEMORT:
Harry.
HARRY:
Sirius.
SNAPE:
I may vomit.
Stop it.
Is this what you call control?
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.
The Dark Lord isn't resting.
You and Black, you're two of a kind.
Sentimental children forever whining...
...about how bitterly unfair
your lives have been.
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.
- Legilimens.
- Protego.
JAMES:
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
Nice one, James.
- Dad.
JAMES: Impedimenta.
ALL :
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?
ALL:
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
SNAPE:
Enough.
Enough.
Your lessons are at an end.
I--
Get out.
FRED: What's your name?
BOY: Michael.
FRED:
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
GEORGE:
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
It's fading already.
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.
UMBRIDGE:
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.
FRED:
You know, George...
...I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.
[FIREWORKS EXPLODING
AND WHISTLING]
FRED:
All right, professor!
Here you go.
Aah!
Ready when you are.
[FRED AND GEORGE LAUGHING
AND WHOOPING]
VOLDEMORT:
I need that prophecy.
SIRIUS:
You'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.
- Crucio.
- Aah!
- Crucio.
- Aah!
Sirius.
HERMIONE:
Harry, are you sure?
HARRY:
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
It's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.
What do we do?
HARRY:
We'll have to use the Floo Network.
HERMIONE: Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.
HARRY:
Not all of them.
HARRY:
Alohomora.
Alert the Order if you can.
RON:
Are you mental? We're going with you.
It's too dangerous.
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.
That you are.
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?
- No.
- Liar.
SNAPE: You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.
Have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.
The last of it on Miss Chang.
Unless you wish to poison him--
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.
--I cannot help you.
HARRY:
He's got Padfoot.
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?
What is he talking about, Snape?
No idea.
Very well.
You give me no choice, Potter.
As this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.
That's illegal.
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.
Tell her, Harry!
Tell me what?
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I Will.
Where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon .
How much further?
Not far.
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.
What are you doing?
improvising.
UMBRIDGE:
Well?
Where is this weapon?
There isn't one, is there?
You were trying to trick me.
You know...
...I really hate children.
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.
Lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law,
as creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
How dare you?
Filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
Please. Please stop it. Please.
Now, enough. I will have order.
UMBRIDGE:
You filthy animal.
Do you know who I am?
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.
No, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
- But I must not tell lies.
- What are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.
Let me go!
HERMIONE:
Thank you, Grawp.
HARRY:
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.
That was clever, Ron.
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.
So how are we getting to London?
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.
Or was that all just words to you?
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.
So how are we going to get to London?
We fly, of course.
WOMAN'S VOICE:
Department of Mysteries.
This is it.
HARRY:
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.
Ninety-four.
Ninety-five.
- He should be here.
NEVILLE: Harry.
It's got your name on it.
TRELAWNEY: The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.
For neither can live
while the other survives.
HERMIONE:
Harry.
HARRY:
Where's Sirius?
MAN: You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.
Now, hand me the prophecy.
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.
LESTRANGE:
He knows how to play.
Itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?
Better, now they're about to be avenged.
Now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
All we want is that prophecy.
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?
LESTRANGE :
You dare speak his name?
You filthy half-blood!
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.
Which is lucky for you, really.
Haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?
Why he was unable to kill you...
...when you were just an infant?
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.
All you have to do...
...is give it to me.
Then I can show you everything.
HARRY:
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.
STUDENTS:
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
NEVILLE:
Petrificus Totalus.
Well done, Neville.
Stupefy-
- Stupefy-
- Stupefy-
Stupefy-
Reducto.
HARRY:
Get back to the door.
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?
HARRY:
The voices.
Can you tell what they're saying?
There aren't any voices, Harry.
Let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
HERMIONE:
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
Please, Harry.
Get behind me.
Did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...
...that children stood a chance
against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
Give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
- Don't give it to him, Harry.
- Shh!
Get away from my godson.
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.
What? No, I'm staying with you.
You've done beautifully.
Now, let me take it from here.
LUCIUS:
Black.
Expelliarmus!
Nice one, James.
LESTRANGE:
Avada Kedavra.
No. No.
LESTRANGE:
I killed Sirius Black. Ha-ha-ha!
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.
VOLDEMORT:
You've got to mean it, Harry.
She killed him. She deserves it.
You know the spell, Harry.
Do it.
VOLDEMORT:
So weak.
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.
The Aurors are on their way.
By which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
You've lost, old man.
Harry.
Aah!
VOLDEMORT:
So weak.
So vulnerable.
Look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
It's how you are not.
Aah!
Harry?
You're the weak one...
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.
And I feel sorry for you.
You're a fool, Harry Potter.
And you will lose everything.
He's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
No, you don't.
It's my fault.
No, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...
...he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.
The prophecy said:
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."
It means one of us
is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.
The same reason your friends saved you.
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
How come you're not at the feast?
Lost all my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding them.
- That's awful.
- Oh, it's all good fun.
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.
Do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?
That's all right.
Anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.
If not always in the way we expect.
Think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.
What's that?
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.
Yeah?
Something worth fighting for.
I killed Sirius Black!
He's back.
The police are continuing
with the investigation...
...into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.
Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.
The surrounding area remains closed.
The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...
"Harry Potter."
Who's Harry Potter?
Oh, no one.
Bit of a tosser, really.
Funny, that paper of yours.
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.
- Hey, I was wondering--
- Eleven. That's when I get off.
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.
I like riding around on trains.
Takes my mind off things.
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.
But now is not the time to tell it.
Take my arm.
Do as I say.
I just Apparated, didn't I?
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.
Most people vomit the first time.
I can't imagine why.
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.
Harry, I assume, right about now, you must
be wondering why I brought you here.
Am I right?
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.
Wands out, Harry.
Horace?
Horace?
Merlin's beard!
No need to disfigure me, Albus.
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
It's all in the upholstery. I come by
the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
Dragon's blood.
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...
...Horace Slughorn.
Horace...
...well, you know who this is.
Harry Potter.
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.
Do you know what that's like?
You can only say no so many times,
so I never stay anywhere more than a week.
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.
That was fun.
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.
You're very like your father.
- Except for the eyes. You have your--
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.
Even more impressive
when one considers she was Muggle-born.
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.
Right at the front.
All mine. Each and every one.
Ex-students, I mean.
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.
Always takes my owl, should I wish to
register an opinion on the news of the day.
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.
Free tickets whenever I want them.
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.
Ah, yes.
Regulus Black.
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.
It's a shame. Talented boy.
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.
Horace?
Do you mind if I take this?
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.
Well, bye-bye, Horace.
Bye.
All right. I'll do it.
But I want Professor Merrythought's
old office, not the water closet I had before.
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!
They are indeed.
Sir, exactly what was all that about?
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.
You would be his crowning jewel.
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.
It's all right, sir.
I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?
Both are waiting for you.
Hedwig.
Mum?
Ginny, what is it?
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?
He's wandering about the house.
- Really?
- Really.
Harry!
Harry!
Hello.
What a lovely surprise.
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.
But then, what would we do
without him?
Got a bit of toothpaste.
So when did you get here?
A few days ago.
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.
Mum sort of lost it last week.
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.
That it's too dangerous.
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?
There's been a lot of talk recently that...
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.
Rubbish! Well, he's only...
What is he?
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!
The Dark Lord trusts him.
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.
Run along, Wormtail.
I know I ought not to be here.
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
You?
The Dark Lord told you?
Your sister doubts me.
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.
I don't doubt you, Severus.
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.
He's just a boy.
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.
- Severus.
- Swear to it.
Make the Unbreakable Vow.
It's just empty words.
He'll give it his best effort.
But when it matters most...
...he'll just slither back into his hole.
Coward.
Take out your wand.
Will you...
...Severus Snape...
...watch over Draco Malfoy...
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?
I Will.
And will you, to the best of your ability...
...protect him from harm?
I Will.
And if Draco should fail...
...will you yourself carry out the deed...
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?
I Will.
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!
Nosebleed Nougats!
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!
-Into the cauldron, handsome.
-Into the cauldron, handsome.
I will have order!
I really hate children. I will have order!
I really hate children. I will have order!
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.
Meaning?
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
It's none of your business.
How much for this?
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.
I'm your brother.
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.
Come on, let's go.
Hi, Ron.
Hi.
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.
I reckon he's right.
Oh, no.
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.
Harry?
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like
two people who don't want to be followed?
Quibbler.
Quibbler.
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.
Quibbler.
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?
And who were all those people?
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.
It's happened. He's one of them.
One of what?
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
You're barking.
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?
Well, then what's he doing in
Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.
I told you, I don't know what I saw.
I need some air.
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...
...if I had to continue
for another two years.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's just say I don't think you'll see me
wasting my time in Charms class next year.
Amused, Blaise?
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.
You two go on.
I wanna check something.
Where's Harry?
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?
Petrificus Totalus.
Oh, yeah...
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.
Finite.
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.
That's nice.
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.
Right. Names?
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.
No exceptions, Potter.
Who are those people?
Aurors. For security.
What's this cane here, then?
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
Nice face, Potter.
Would you like me to fix it for you?
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...
...but it's up to you.
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.
"Ah!
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.
Brilliant.
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.
Will you stop eating?
Your best friend is missing!
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.
He's covered in blood again.
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.
Where have you been?
- What happened to your face?
- Later.
What've I missed?
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?
Very best of evenings to you all.
Thanks.
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...
...Horace Slughorn.
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...
...will be taken by Professor Snape.
Snape?
Now, as you know...
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.
And you have the right to know why.
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...
...sat in this very hall...
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.
His name?
Torn Riddle.
Today, of course...
...he's known all over the world
by another name.
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.
Every day, every hour...
...this very minute, perhaps...
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.
Just something to think about.
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.
That was cheerful.
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.
Potter.
Oh, this can't be good.
Enjoying ourselves, are we?
- I had a free period this morning, professor.
- So I noticed.
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T.s students...
...with "Exceeds Expectations."
Brilliant. Um...
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.
I don't wanna take Potions.
There's Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.
Attention to detail in the
preparation is the prerequisite of all planning.
Ah.
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.
Ron Weasley, sir.
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.
Get what you want from the cupboard.
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.
Any ideas what these might be?
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.
It's terribly tricky to make.
And this is Amortentia...
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.
For example, I smell...
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...
...spearmint toothpaste.
Now, Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.
Oh, yes.
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.
But it is more commonly referred to as--
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.
At least until the effects wear off.
So this is what I offer each of you today.
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.
Let the brewing commence.
How did you do that?
You crush it. Don't cut it.
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.
No, really.
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.
So here we are, then, as promised.
One vial of Felix Felicis.
Congratulations.
Use it well.
Harry, you got my message. Come in.
How are you?
I'm fine, sir.
Enjoying your classes?
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
Do you?
Definitely.
What about your activities
outside the classroom?
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.
I can't help wondering...
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.
But enough chitchat.
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.
The answer lies here.
What you are looking at are memories.
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.
This vial contains
the most particular memory...
...of the day I first met him.
I'd like you to see it, if you would.
I admit some confusion
upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.
Torn, you have a visitor.
How do you do, Tom?
Don't.
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.
I am a professor.
I don't believe you.
She wants me looked at.
They think I'm different.
Well, perhaps they're right.
I'm not mad.
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
Hogwarts is a school.
A school of magic.
You can do things, can't you, Torn?
Things other children can't.
I can make things move
without touching them.
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.
I can make them hurt...
...if I want.
Who are you?
Well, I'm like you, Tom.
I'm different.
Prove it.
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Torn.
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.
You understand me?
I can speak to snakes too.
They find me.
Whisper things.
Is that normal for someone like me?
Did you know, sir? Then?
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.
If I had, l...
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?
No, I did not.
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.
And he will not give it up easily.
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.
I did.
Do you want me to let him?
Yes.
All right. Um...
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...
...just to assess your strengths.
Quiet! Please!
Shut it!
Thanks. All right. Um...
Just because you
made the team last year...
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?
Good.
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?
Hard feelings?
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.
Really? Strapping guy like you?
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?
Keepers need to be quick, agile.
Oh, I like my chances.
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?
Come on, Weasley!
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!
Go on, Cormac!
Come on, Ron!
Come on, Ron.
Come on, Ron.
Confundus.
Isn't he brilliant?
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.
He's vile.
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?
No, I haven't.
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.
What?
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.
No.
Why not?
The binding is fragile.
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince."
For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...
...yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.
Well, it's true.
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.
It's just like being with Hermione.
Well, I was curious, so I went to--
- The library.
- The library. And?
And nothing.
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...
No, not there. Over here.
No, sit beside me.
Okay.
Something to drink?
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.
Oh, bloody hell.
Slick git.
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.
And snagging-
- I'd like to leave.
- What?
You can't be serious.
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.
And you, and you.
So, what brings you here?
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...
...for the select student or two.
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.
You would be welcome too, Granger.
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.
Good to see you, Wallenby.
What are you playing at?
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
Got a little bit...
Katie, you don't know what it could be.
- Harry.
- What?
Did you hear what she was saying
back at the pub about me and her snogging?
As if.
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.
Do not touch that, except by the wrappings.
Do you understand?
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?
It's like I said.
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.
She said it was important
that she deliver it.
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.
What do you think?
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
She was cursed, wasn't she?
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.
Yes, she was cursed.
It was Malfoy.
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.
Indeed.
- Your evidence?
- I just know.
You just...
...know.
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?
Well, what does she see in him?
Dean? He's brilliant.
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.
I suppose.
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.
She's smart, funny.
- Attractive.
- Attractive?
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.
Hermione's got nice skin.
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.
I've never really thought about it.
But, I suppose, yeah.
Very nice.
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.
Well, be sure to give them both my best.
What about your uncle, Belby?
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?
My parents are dentists.
They tend to people's teeth.
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?
No.
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.
He needed 10 stitches.
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.
Sorry. I'm not usually late.
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.
What?
Nothing.
Goodbye. Bye-bye.
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.
I was just admiring your hourglass.
Oh, yes.
A most intriguing object.
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.
As to some of your classmates...
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.
The shelf, sir?
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle?
You were his teacher.
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.
What was he like?
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.
He killed my parents.
Of course.
It's only natural
you should want to know more.
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.
Not unlike others I've known.
Not unlike yourself, in fact.
If the monster existed...
...it was buried deep within.
Good luck, eh, Ron.
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!
What's he wearing?
So how was it, then?
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?
Pretty boring, actually.
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.
And we're meant to bring someone.
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?
Good luck today, Ron.
I know you'll be brilliant.
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.
Have it your way.
- Juice?
- Sure.
Hello, everyone.
You look dreadful, Ron.
Is that why you put something
in his cup?
Is it a tonic?
Liquid luck.
Don't drink it, Ron.
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.
Yes!
Go on, Ron! Do it!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Yes!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Whoo!
Yes. Whoo!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
You really shouldn't have done it.
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.
You didn't put it in.
Ron only thought you did.
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.
Well, they're really good.
How does it feel, Harry?
When you see Dean with Ginny?
I know.
I see the way you look at her.
You're my best friend.
Oops.
I think this room's taken.
What's with the birds?
Oppugno.
It feels like this.
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.
It's chemical.
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.
He's at perfect liberty to kiss
whoever he likes. I really couldn't care less.
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?
Yes.
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.
Have you?
Yes. Why?
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...
...we should go together, as friends.
Why didn't I think of that?
Who are you going with?
Um, it's a surprise.
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about.
You can't just take anyone.
See that girl over there?
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.
Really?
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.
But I am the Chosen One.
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.
I'll ask someone I like.
Someone cool.
I've never been to this part of the castle.
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.
That's why I wear shoes to bed.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Drink?
Neville.
I didn't get into the Slug Club.
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.
Cormac? That's who you invited?
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.
On second thoughts...
Might keep Cormac at bay.
Oh, God, here he comes.
I think she just went to powder her nose.
Slippery little minx, your friend.
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?
What is this I'm eating, by the way?
Dragon balls.
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.
Not so quick, Potter.
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.
You see...
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.
Traveling where?
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!
Professor Slughorn, sir.
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.
He claims to have been
invited to your party.
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?
I'll escort him out.
Certainly, professor.
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?
I swore to protect you.
I made the Unbreakable Vow.
I don't need protection.
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.
You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious.
Let me assist you.
No!
I was chosen. This is my moment.
"Unbreakable Vow."
You're sure that's what Snape said?
Positive. Why?
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.
You don't understand.
Oh, bloody hell.
I miss you.
Lovely.
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.
I'll take your word for it.
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?
You die.
Wait, the pudding's still here.
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?
I know it sounds mad.
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...
...so he could find out
what he was up to?
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's--
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.
You're blinded by hatred.
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.
We place our trust
in a handful of people.
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.
Open up, you.
Don't you trust me?
It's good.
Yeah, I'll just-- Get-- Yeah.
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.
You'll have to forgive Remus.
It takes its toll, his condition.
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?
We're being followed, all of us.
Most clays,
Molly doesn't leave the house.
It's not been easy.
Did you get my owl?
Yes, I did.
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.
As for Draco Malfoy...
...I know a bit more.
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.
I think, from what you described...
...what you and Ron saw in summer...
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...
...is a vanishing cabinet.
A vanishing cabinet?
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.
They can transport you anywhere.
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?
Nothing.
It's still there.
It was delicious, Molly, really.
Are you sure you won't stay?
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.
Remus?
Sweetheart.
Has Ron gone to bed?
Um... Not yet. No.
Shoelace.
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.
- Harry, no!
- Remus!
Ginny!
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!
You coming to get me?
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?
Harry?
Stupefy!
Harry!
Ginny!
Molly.
It's easy for them to get to you.
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?
Sorry.
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.
That's my Won-Won.
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.
I'd like to know
where you get your information.
More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.
Sir...
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.
But how did you know?
Intuition.
Gracious. Is it that time already?
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.
They might misunderstand.
Go on.
I was in the library the other night...
...in the Restricted Section...
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.
It's called, as I understand it...
I beg your pardon?
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!
Confused?
I'd be surprised if you weren't.
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.
It is also a lie.
This memory has been tampered with...
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?
Why, indeed?
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...
...any way you can.
I don't know him that well, sir.
This memory is everything.
Without it, we are blind.
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.
You have no choice.
You must not fail.
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...
...with the chapter on antidotes.
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?
I'm Potions Master, Harry.
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.
Yes. Um...
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.
What I mean to say is...
...well, he's not like you.
He might misunderstand.
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.
I suggest you do the same.
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?
Didn't he?
Yes?
Oh, it's you, Potter.
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.
Divine.
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.
She could never annoy me.
I think I love her.
Well, brilliant.
Do you think she knows I exist?
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.
Snogging? Who are you talking about?
Who are you talking about?
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.
Okay, very funny.
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?
No. Can you introduce me?
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.
Where's Romilda?
What's the matter with Wenby?
Very powerful love potion.
Very well. Better bring him in.
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
Perhaps you're right.
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.
All the questions about Voldemort.
Don't use that name.
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.
A bloody strong one at that.
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up, my boy.
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...
Here we are, Potter.
To life!
Ron.
Ron. Professor, do something.
I don't understand.
Come on, Ron, breathe.
These girls, they're gonna kill me.
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.
The question is,
why were they necessary?
Why, indeed?
This appears to be a gift, Horace.
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...
...when not polluted with poison.
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.
To whom, I might ask?
To you, Headmaster.
Where is he?
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?
What's she doing here?
I might ask you the same question.
I happen to be his girlfriend.
I happen to be his friend.
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.
Ah. See? He senses my presence.
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.
I'm here.
Uh... Hermione...
Hermione.
Hermione.
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.
Well, come away, everybody.
Mr. Weasley is well tended.
About time, don't you think?
Thank you.
Oh, shut up.
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.
Um, well...
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.
And you talked.
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.
It's just she seems a bit put out.
Yes, she does, doesn't she?
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?
Anything at all?
There is something.
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
Right. Boggled.
Harry.
That's Katie.
Katie Bell.
Katie. How are you?
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.
I've been trying to remember, honestly.
But I just can't.
Katie?
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?
Sectumsempra!
Vulnera Sanentur.
Vulnera Sanentur.
Vulnera Sanentur.
You have to get rid of it. Today.
Take my hand.
The Room of Requirement.
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.
- What was that?
- What was that?
See?
You never know what you'll find up here.
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.
Close your eyes.
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.
So did you and Ginny do it, then?
What?
You know, hide the book?
Oh, yeah.
Ah. Dear, yes.
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?
Luck.
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.
Well, how do you feel?
Excellent.
Really excellent.
Remember...
...Slughorn usually eats early...
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.
Right.
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.
- We have a plan.
- I know...
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.
Or Felix does.
Hi!
Merlin's beard, Harry!
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?
Well, just the general behavior, sir.
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?
Through the front door, sir.
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...
...and I fancied paying him a visit.
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.
Harry!
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...
...back to the castle immediately!
That would be counterproductive, sir.
And what makes you say that?
No idea.
Horace.
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?
A dead one, I think, sir.
Good God.
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.
- I'm so sorry, I didn't--
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.
Not to mention the pincers.
Yeah, I reckon that too.
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...
...but Acromantula venom
is uncommonly rare.
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?
My thoughts exactly.
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.
Oh, dear.
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.
He had a family, I trust?
Oh, yeah.
Farewell...
Aragog.
Farewell, Aragog...
...king of the arachnids.
Your body will decay...
...but your spirit lingers on.
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.
Poof
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?
But that's life, I suppose.
You go along and then suddenly, poof!
- Poof.
- Poof.
It was a student who gave me Francis.
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.
As I watched, it sank.
Just before it reached the bottom...
...it transformed...
...into a wee fish.
It was beautiful magic.
Wondrous to behold.
The flower petal had come from a lily.
Your mother.
The day I came downstairs...
...the day the bowl was empty...
...was the day your mother...
I know why you're here.
But I can't help you.
It would ruin me.
Do you know why I survived, professor?
The night I got this?
Because of her.
Because she sacrificed herself.
Because she refused to step aside.
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.
I'm going to tell you something.
Something others have only guessed at.
It's true.
I am the Chosen One.
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...
...and I need to know what you told him.
Be brave, professor.
Be brave like my mother.
Otherwise, you disgrace her.
Otherwise, she died for nothing.
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.
I was in the library the other night...
...in the Restricted Section...
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.
It's called, as I understand it...
...a Horcrux.
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.
I came across the term while reading...
...and I didn't fully understand it.
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom,
but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.
Which is...
...why I came to you.
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.
Protected?
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.
In other words, you cannot die.
And how does one split his soul, sir?
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.
Murder.
Yes.
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.
Can you only split the soul once?
For instance, isn't seven...?
Seven?
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?
To rip the soul into seven pieces...
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?
Of course, sir.
It'll be our little secret.
Sir.
This is beyond anything I imagined.
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.
What are they exactly?
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.
A ring, for example.
Or a book.
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...
One destroys Voldemort.
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.
True. But magic, especially dark magic...
...leaves traces.
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...
...that you take too much for granted?
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.
Oh, Harry.
You need a shave, my friend.
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.
I'm an old man.
You still look the same to me, sir.
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.
But there is one condition:
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.
Yes, sir.
You do understand what I'm saying?
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.
Should I tell you to run, you run.
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.
Your word, Harry.
My word.
Take my arm.
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.
Well, being me has its privileges.
This is the place.
Oh, yes.
This place has known magic.
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...
...payment must be made.
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.
Your bloods much more precious
than mine.
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.
He will have put certain defenses
in position.
Careful.
There it is.
The only question is,
how do we get there?
If you would, Harry.
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
Oh, yes.
It has to be drunk.
All of it has to be drunk.
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?
This potion might paralyze me.
Might make me forget why I'm here.
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.
You are not to indulge these requests.
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.
Your good health, Harry.
Professor.
Professor!
Harry.
Professor, can you hear me?
Professor.
No. Don't.
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...
-...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!
It's my fault.
It's all my fault.
It's my fault.
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...
...I promise I'll do what you say.
- I promise.
- No.
Please.
Harry.
Water.
Water.
Water.
You did it, sir.
Look.
Harry.
Water.
Aguamenti.
Water.
Lumos.
Lumos Maximal
Harry.
Sectumsempra!
Harry.
- Stupefy!
- Harry.
Harry.
Partis Temporus!
Go to your houses. No dawdling.
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.
No.
Severus. Severus is who I need.
Wake him. Tell him what happened.
Speak to no one else.
Severus, Harry.
Hide yourself below, Harry.
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.
Harry, do as I say.
Trust me.
Trust me.
Good evening, Draco.
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?
Who else is here? I heard you talking.
I often talk aloud to myself.
I find it extraordinarily useful.
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?
Draco...
-...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?
I've done things that would shock you.
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?
Forgive me, Draco.
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...
...your heart can't really
have been in them.
He trusts me. I was chosen.
Then I shall make it easy for you.
Expelliarmus!
Very good. Very good.
You're not alone.
There are others.
How?
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.
It has a sister. A twin.
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.
Ingenious.
Draco...
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!
Don't you understand? I have to do this.
I have to kill you.
Or he's gonna kill me.
Well, look what we have here.
Well done, Draco.
Good evening, Bellatrix.
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.
Do it.
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.
Let me finish him in my own way.
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.
This is your moment. Do it.
Go on, Draco.
NOW!
No.
Severus.
Please.
Avada Kedavra.
Yeah!
Hagrid! Hello?
Snape! He trusted you!
Go on.
Incarcerous.
Fight back! You coward, fight back!
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.
Sectumsempra!
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?
Yes.
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
McGONAGALL:
Potter...
...in light of what has happened...
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...
...you meant a great deal to him.
Do you think he would've done it?
Draco?
No.
No, he was lowering his wand.
In the end, it was Snape.
It was always Snape.
And I did nothing.
It's fake.
Open it.
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...
...you will be mortal once more.
R.A.B."
R.A.B.
Don't know.
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.
Which means it was all a waste.
All of it.
Ron's okay with it, you know.
You and Ginny.
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
I'm not coming back, Hermione.
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.
And I don't know where that'll lead me...
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.
I've always admired your courage, Harry.
But sometimes, you can be really thick.
You don't really think
you're going to be able...
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?
You need us, Harry.
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
These are dark times,
there is no denying.
Our world has, perhaps, faced
no greater threat than it does today.
But I say this to our citizenry:
We, ever your servants...
...will continue to
defend your liberty...
...and repel the forces
that seek to take it from you.
Your Ministry remains...
...strong.
Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.
Coming, Mom.
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.
I still don't understand
why we have to leave.
Because, uh, it's not
safe for us here anymore.
Ron, tell your father
supper's nearly ready.
Is this in Australia?
Looks wonderful, doesn't it?
Three and a half thousand
kilometers along Australia's east coast.
Obliviate.
Severus.
I was beginning to worry
you had lost your way.
Come, we've saved you a seat.
You bring news, I trust?
It will happen Saturday
next, at nightfall.
I've heard differently, my Lord.
Dawlish, the Auror, has let
slip that the Potter boy...
...will not be moved until
the 30th of this month.
The day before he turns 17.
This is a false trail.
The Auror Office no longer plays any
part in the protection of Harry Potter.
Those closest to him believe
we have infiltrated the Ministry.
Well, they got that
right, haven't they?
What say you, Pius?
One hears many
things, my Lord.
Whether the truth is
among them is not clear.
Heh. Spoken like
a true politician.
You will, I think,
prove most useful, Pius.
- Where will he be taken, the boy?
- To a safe house.
Most likely the home of someone
in the Order.
I'm told it's been given every
manner of protection possible.
Once there, it will be
impractical to attack him.
Ahem. My Lord. I'd like to
volunteer myself for this task.
I want to kill the boy.
Wormtail!
Have I not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet?
Yes, my Lord.
Right away, my Lord.
As inspiring as I find
your bloodlust, Bellatrix...
...I must be the one
to kill Harry Potter.
But I face an
unfortunate complication.
That my wand and Potter's
share the same core.
They are, in some ways, twins.
We can wound, but not
fatally harm one another.
If I am to kill him...
...I must do it with
another's wand.
Come, surely one of you
would like the honor?
Mm?
What about you, Lucius?
My Lord?
"My Lord?"
I require your wand.
Do I detect elm?
Yes, my Lord.
And the core?
Dragon. Ahem.
Dragon heartstring, my Lord.
- Dragon heartstring.
- Mm.
To those of you
who do not know...
...we are joined tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage...
...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Her specialty was
Muggle Studies.
It is Miss Burbage's belief that
Muggles are not so different from us.
She would, given her way...
...have us mate with them.
To her, the mixture of magical and
Muggle blood is not an abomination...
...but something to be encouraged.
Severus.
Severus, please.
We're friends.
Avada Kedavra!
Nagini.
Dinner.
- Hello, Harry.
- All right. Wow.
Hello.
- You're looking fit.
- Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.
What say we get undercover
before someone murders him?
Evening.
I thought you were looking
after the Prime Minister.
You are more important.
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Oh. Pleasure to meet you.
- He was never always this handsome.
- Dead ugly.
True enough.
Owe it all to a werewolf,
name of Greyback.
- Hope to repay the favor one day.
- You're still beautiful to me, William.
Just remember, Fleur, Bill takes
his steaks on the raw side now.
My husband, the joker.
By the way, wait till you hear
the news. Remus and I--
All right. We'll have time
for a cozy catch-up later.
We've got to get the hell
out of here. And soon.
Potter, you're underage, which means
you've still got the Trace on you.
What's the Trace?
If you sneeze, the Ministry
will know who wipes your nose.
We have to use those means of
transport the Trace can't detect:
Brooms, Thestrals and
the like. We go in pairs.
That way, if anyone's out there waiting
for us, and I reckon there will be...
...they won't know which
Harry Potter is the real one.
The real one?
I believe you're familiar
with this particular brew.
No. Absolutely not.
I told you he'd take it well.
No, if you think I'm gonna let
everyone risk their lives for me, I--
- Never done that before, have we?
- No. No. This is different.
I mean, taking that,
becoming me. No.
Well, none of us
really fancy it, mate.
Imagine if something went wrong, and
we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.
Everyone here is of age, Potter.
They've all agreed
to take the risk.
Technically, I've been coerced.
Mundungus Fletcher,
Mr. Potter.
- Always been a huge admirer.
- Nip it, Mundungus.
All right, Granger,
as discussed.
- Blimey, Hermione.
- Straight in here, if you please.
For those of you who haven't taken
Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:
It tastes like goblin piss.
Have a lot of experiences
with that, do you, Mad-Eye?
Just trying to
diffuse the tension.
Oh.
Ugh.
Wow, we're identical.
Not yet, you're not.
Haven't got anything a bit
more sporting, have you?
I don't really fancy this color.
Well, fancy this, you're
not you. So shut it and strip.
All right, all right.
You'll need to change too, Potter.
Bill, look away. I'm hideous.
I knew she was lying
about that tattoo.
Harry, your eyesight
really is awful.
Right, then. We'll be pairing off.
Each Potter will have a protector.
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I wanna keep an eye on you.
- As for Harry--
- Yes?
The real Harry.
- Where the devil are you, anyway?
- Here.
You'll ride with Hagrid.
I brought you here 16 years ago when
you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.
Seems only right that I should be
the one to take you away now.
Yes, it's all very
touching. Let's go.
Head for the Burrows.
We'll rendezvous there.
On the count of three.
Hold tight, Harry.
One...
...two...
...three!
- Which one?
- Where are you?
He's on your right!
He's over there!
Down!
Hagrid, we have to
help the others!
I can't do that, Harry.
Mad-Eye's orders.
Hang on.
Stupefy!
Hang on, Harry.
Hagrid.
No. No.
Harry.
Harry. Hagrid.
What happened?
Where are the others?
Is no one else back?
They were on us right from the
start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.
Well, thank goodness
you two are all right.
The Death Eaters were
waiting for us. It was an ambush.
Ron and Tonks should've
already been back.
Dad and Fred as well.
Here!
Quick. Into the house.
Oh, my boy.
Oh. Oh.
- Lupin!
- What are you doing?
What creature sat
in the corner...
...the first time Harry Potter
visited my office in Hogwarts?
- Are you mad?
- What creature?!
A Grindylow.
We've been betrayed.
Voldemort knew you were
being moved tonight.
I had to make sure you
weren't an impostor.
Wait.
The last words Albus Dumbledore
spoke to the pair of us?
"Harry is the best hope
we have. Trust him."
What gave you away?
Hedwig, I think. She was
trying to protect me.
Thanks.
Deserves that.
Brilliant, he was.
- I wouldn't be standing here without him.
- Really?
Always the tone of surprise.
We the last back?
Where's George?
How you feeling, Georgie?
Saint-like.
Come again?
Saint-like. I'm holy.
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?
The whole wide world of ear-related
humor and you go for "I'm holey."
That's pathetic.
Reckon I'm still
better-looking than you.
Mad-Eye's dead.
Mundungus took one look at
Voldemort and Disapparated.
Head for the Burrows.
This is beyond
anything I imagined.
- Seven?
- Seven...? A Horcrux.
They could be
hidden anywhere.
To rip the soul
into seven pieces....
- If you did destroy each Horcrux....
- One destroys Voldemort.
Trust me.
You lied to me.
Lied to me, Ollivander.
Going somewhere?
Nobody else is going
to die. Not for me.
For you?
You think Mad-Eye
died for you?
You think George took
that curse for you?
You may be the Chosen One, mate,
but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
It's always been bigger than that.
- Come with me.
- What, and leave Hermione?
You mad? We wouldn't
last two days without her.
Don't tell her I said that.
Besides, you've still got
the Trace on you.
- We've still got the wedding--
- I don't care about a wedding.
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.
They're our only
chance to beat him...
...and the longer we stay
here, the stronger he gets.
Tonight's not the night, mate.
We'd only be doing him a favor.
Do you think he knows?
I mean, they're bits of his soul,
these Horcruxes. Bits of him.
When Dumbledore destroyed the
ring, you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...
...he must have felt something.
To kill the other Horcruxes,
we have to find them.
Where are they?
Where do we start?
Ready when you are.
Please pay attention! It's your
brother's wedding. Buck up.
Zip me up, will you?
It seems silly,
doesn't it, a wedding?
Given everything
that's going on.
Maybe that's the best
reason to have it...
...because of everything
that's going on.
Morning.
Come on, keep up.
All together now.
One, two, three.
How's it looking at
your end, boys?
Brilliant.
Bloody hell. What's the
Minister of Magic doing here?
To what do we owe
the pleasure, Minister?
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.
And this is...?
"Herein is set forth the
last will and testament...
...of Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...
...I leave my Deluminator...
...a device of my own making...
...in the hope that, when
things seem most dark...
...it will show him the light."
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yeah.
Brilliant.
What is it?
Wicked.
"To Hermione Jean Granger...
...I leave my copy of
The Tales of Beedle the Bard...
...in the hope that she find it
entertaining and instructive."
Mom used to read me those.
"The Wizard and
the Hopping Pot."
"Babbitty Rabbitty and
the Cackling Stump."
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.
No?
"To Harry James Potter...
...I leave the Snitch he caught in
his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...
...as a reminder of the
rewards of perseverance...
...and skill."
- Is that it, then?
- Not quite.
Dumbledore left you
a second bequest:
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.
As an important historical
artifact, it belongs--
To Harry.
It belongs to Harry.
It came to him when he needed
it in the Chamber of Secrets.
The sword may present itself
to any worthy Gryffindor.
That does not make it
that wizard's property.
And, in any event, the current
whereabouts of the sword are unknown.
- Excuse me?
- The sword is missing.
I don't know what
you're up to, Mr. Potter...
...but you can't fight
this war on your own.
He's too strong.
Hello, Harry.
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?
I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.
Of course not.
How are you, Luna?
Very well. Got bitten by a
garden gnome only moments ago.
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I trust you know, Mr. Potter,
that we at The Quibbler...
...unlike those toadies
at The Daily Prophet...
...fully supported
Dumbledore in his lifetime...
...and, in his death,
support you just as fully.
Thank you.
Come, Daddy. Harry doesn't
want to talk to us right now.
He's just too polite to say so.
Harry Potter.
Excuse me, sir?
May I sit down?
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.
Thanks.
I found what you wrote in
The Daily Prophet really moving.
You obviously knew
Dumbledore well.
Well, I certainly knew
him the longest.
That is, if you don't count
his brother, Aberforth...
...and somehow, people never
do seem to count Aberforth.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.
- Ah.
Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.
Don't despair, Elphias.
I'm told he's been thoroughly
unriddled by Rita Skeeter...
...in 800 pages, no less.
Word has it that
someone talked to her.
Someone who knew the
Dumbledore family well.
Both you and I know
who that is, Elphias.
A monstrous betrayal.
Who are we talking about?
Bathilda Bagshot.
- Who?
- My God, boy...
...she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.
She was as close to the
Dumbledores as anyone.
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought
it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...
...to take a peek into that
old bird's rattled cage.
Godric's Hollow?
Bathilda Bagshot
lives at Godric's Hollow?
Well, that's where she
first met Dumbledore.
You don't mean to say
he lived there too?
The family moved there after
his father killed those three Muggles.
Oh, it was quite the scandal.
Honestly, my boy, are you
sure you knew him at all?
The Ministry has fallen.
The Minister of Magic is dead.
They are coming.
They are coming.
They are coming.
They're coming!
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.
- Ginny!
- Harry! Go!
Go!
Here you go, sightseeing tour?
Leaves in 15 minutes.
- Where are we?
- Shaftesbury Avenue.
I used to come to the theater
here with Mom and Dad.
I don't know why I thought of it.
It just popped into my head.
This way.
We need to change.
How the ruddy...?
Undetectable Extension Charm.
You're amazing, you are.
Always the tone of surprise.
Ah. That'll be the books.
What about all the
people at the wedding?
- Do you think we should go back?
- They were after you.
We'd put everyone in
danger by going back.
- Ron's right.
- Ahem.
Coffee?
- A cappuccino, please.
- You?
- What she said.
- Same.
So where do we go from here?
Leaky Cauldron?
It's too dangerous.
If Voldemort has taken over the
Ministry, none of the old places are safe.
Everyone from the wedding will
have gone underground, into hiding.
My rucksack with all my things,
I've left it at the Burrow.
You're joking.
I've had all the essentials
packed for days, just in case.
By the way, these jeans,
not my favorite.
Down!
Stupefy!
Expulso!
Petrificus Totalus.
Go.
Leave.
Lock the door, get the lights.
This one's name is Rowle.
He was on the Astronomy Tower
the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
This is Dolohov. I recognize
him from the wanted posters.
So, what we gonna
do with you, hey?
Kill us if it was turned
round, wouldn't you?
If we kill them, they'll
know we were here.
Ron.
Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?
It's better we wipe
their memories.
You're the boss.
Hermione...
...you're the
best at spells.
Obliviate.
How is it they knew
we were there?
Maybe you still have
the Trace on you?
Can't be. Trace breaks
at 17. It's wizarding law.
What?
We didn't celebrate
your birthday, Harry.
Ginny and I, we
prepared a cake.
We were going to bring it out
at the end of the wedding.
I appreciate the thought, but given
the fact that we were almost killed...
...by a couple of Death
Eaters a few minutes ago....
Right.
Perspective.
We need to get off the
streets, get somewhere safe.
What was that all about?
Probably Mad-Eye's idea, in case
Snape decided to come snooping.
Homenum Revelio.
We're alone.
I believed another wand-
You lied to me.
It makes no sense.
I believed a different wand
would work, I swear.
There must be another way.
Harry? Hermione,
where are you?
I think I've found something.
Lovely.
"Regulus Arcturus Black."
R.A.B.
"I know I will be dead
long before you read this.
I have stolen the real Horcrux
and intend to destroy it."
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.
Yes.
Question is, did he actually
destroy the real Horcrux?
You've been spying
on us, have you?
Kreacher has been watching.
Maybe he knows
where the real locket is.
Have you ever
seen this before?
Kreacher?
It's Master Regulus' locket.
But there were two,
weren't there?
Where's the other one?
Kreacher doesn't know
where the other locket is.
Yes, but did you ever see it?
Was it in this house?
Filthy Mudblood.
- Death Eaters are coming--
- Ron.
- Blood traitor, Weasley.
- Answer her.
Yes.
It was here in this house.
A most evil object.
How do you mean?
Before Master Regulus died,
he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...
...but no matter how hard
Kreacher tried, he could not do it.
Well, where is it now?
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.
He took many things,
including the locket.
Who did?
Who was it, Kreacher?
Mundungus.
Mundungus Fletcher.
Find him.
My father will hear about this.
Hey, losers.
He isn't here.
As your new
Minister for Magic...
...I promise to restore
this temple of tolerance...
...to its former glory.
Therefore, beginning today...
...each employee will
submit themselves...
...for evaluation.
You have nothing to fear...
...if you have nothing to hide.
- How much?
- Two Galleons.
Come on, time is
money. Cheers, pal.
- Snatchers!
- Move out of the way.
- I told you.
- Get out.
Squash him.
Be a bit gentler.
They have flesh memories.
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought it might open at your touch.
That Dumbledore had
hidden something inside it.
Many of you
are wondering...
...why Voldemort has yet to show
himself now that he has vanquished...
...the most powerful symbol of
opposition to him and his followers.
Get off.
Harry Potter, so long it's been.
Get off me.
As requested, Kreacher has
returned with the thief...
- Expellliarmus.
- ... Mundungus Fletcher.
What you playing at? Setting a pair
of bleeding house-elves after me.
Dobby was only trying to help.
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
which Dobby thought was curious.
And then Dobby heard Kreacher
mention Harry Potter's name.
- I just--
- And then Dobby saw Kreacher...
- ...talking with the thief, Mundungus--
- I'm no thief.
You foul little-- Git.
I'm a purveyor of rare
and wondrous objects.
You're a thief, Dung.
Everyone knows it.
Master Weasley, so good
to see you again.
Wicked trainers.
Listen, I panicked
that night, all right?
Could I help it if Mad-Eye
fell off his broom?
- You....
- Tell the truth.
When you turned this
place over-- Don't deny it.
--you found a locket,
am I right?
Why? Was it valuable?
You still got it?
No, he's worried he didn't
get enough money for it.
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?
There I was, flogging me
wares in Diagon Alley...
...when some Ministry hag comes
up and asks to see me license.
Says she's a mind
to lock me up.
And would've done it too, if she
hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
- No, I--
Well, she's there. Look.
Bleeding bow and all.
Right, remember what we said.
Don't speak to anyone
unless absolutely necessary.
Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.
If we do that, then with a
bit of luck, we'll get inside.
- And then--
- It gets really tricky.
- Correct.
- Yeah.
- This is completely mental.
- Completely.
The world's mental.
Come on...
...we've got a Horcrux to find.
We flush ourselves in.
That's bloody disgusting.
Name?
You. Come.
- What? What?
- Come on.
- What did I do?
- Just keep walking.
- Are those--?
- Muggles.
In their rightful place.
Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a bit.
How long did you say this batch
of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?
I didn't.
Cattermole.
It's still raining inside my
office. That's two days now.
Have you tried an umbrella?
You do realize I'm going
downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.
Now, if my wife's blood
status were in doubt...
...and the head of the Department
of Magical Law Enforcement...
...needed a job doing, I think
I might just make that a priority.
You have one hour.
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
My wife's all alone downstairs.
- Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh, right.
Level 2.
But how do I stop it raining?
Try "Finite Incantatem."
Department of Magical
Law Enforcement...
...and Improper Use of
Magic Department.
This is you, Ron.
Finite Incantatem. Okay.
And if that doesn't work...?
Level 1, Minister of Magic
and support staff.
If we don't locate Umbridge
within the hour...
...we go find Ron and
come back another day.
- Deal?
- Yes.
Ah, Mafalda. Travers
sent you, did he?
Good, we'll go straight down.
Albert, aren't you getting out?
Runcorn.
Accio locket.
All right, all right.
Let's calm down, shall we?
Let's get back to work, please.
Calm down.
Runcorn.
Morning.
Ron, it's me.
Harry. Blimey, forgot
what you looked like.
Where's Hermione?
She's gone down to the
courtrooms, with Umbridge.
Bloody cold down here.
I'm a half-blood.
My father was a wizard.
William Alderton.
He worked here for 30 years.
Perhaps you know him.
Always wore his jacket inside out.
No, there's been a mistake.
I'm half-blood, you see.
We must go back.
I'm half-blood.
- Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
- Yes.
Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens,
Great Tolling, Evesham?
- Yes.
- It's here.
Mother to Maisie, Ellie
and Alfred? Wife to Reginald?
Reg?
Thank you, Albert.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
Yes.
A wand was taken from you upon
your arrival at the Ministry today.
Is this that wand?
Would you please tell the court from
which witch or wizard you took this wand?
I didn't take it.
I got it in Diagon Alley, at
Ollivander's, when I was 11.
It chose me.
You're lying.
Wands only choose witches,
and you are not a witch.
But I am.
Tell them, Reg.
Tell them what I am.
Reg, tell them what I am.
What on earth are
you doing, Albert?
You're lying, Dolores.
And one mustn't tell lies.
Stupefy!
It's Harry Potter.
It is, isn't it?
This'll be one to tell the kids.
Expecto Patronum!
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Mary, go home.
Get the kids.
I'll meet you there. We have to
get out of the country, understand?
Mary, do as I say.
Mary?
Who's that?
Long story. Nice meeting you.
It's Harry Potter.
It's Harry. Harry Potter.
- There he is.
- Get him!
- Get him!
- Stop him!
- Watch out.
- Look out.
This way!
Expellliarmus!
Oh, my God.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's all right. It's okay.
Harry. Harry,
quickly, in my bag.
There's a bottle labeled
"Essence of Dittany."
Shh. Shh.
- Okay, okay.
- Quickly.
- Accio Dittany.
- Shh.
It's all right. Unstopper it.
Hermione, his arm.
I know, just do it.
It's okay.
- Okay, it's gonna sting a little bit.
- What happened? I thought we meant...
- ...to be going back to Grimmauld Place.
- We were. We were. Shh.
It's all right.
One more, one more.
We were there, we were there,
but Yaxley had hold of me, and I....
I knew once he'd seen where
we were, we couldn't stay...
...so I brought us here...
...but Ron got splinched.
It's all right.
Protego Totalum.
Salvio Hexia.
What are you doing?
Protective enchantments.
I don't fancy another visit like the one
we had in Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?
You can get going on the tent.
- Tent?
Protego Totalum.
Where am I supposed
to find a tent?
Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.
You first.
Dissendium.
Incendio.
Expulso.
Diffindo.
Reducto.
What are you doing?
We have to keep it safe until
we find out how to destroy it.
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sends you off...
...to find all these Horcruxes, but
doesn't tell you how to destroy them.
Doesn't that bother you?
A goblin by the name
of Gornuk was killed.
It is believed that Muggle-born
Dean Thomas and a second goblin...
...both believed to have been
traveling with Tonks, Cresswell...
...and Gornuk,
may have escaped.
If Dean is listening or anyone has
any knowledge of his whereabouts...
...his parents and sisters
are desperate for news.
Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five
has been found dead in their home.
You know the spell, Harry.
Tell me.
Tell me, Gregorovitch.
It was stolen from me.
Who was he? The thief?
It was a boy.
It was he who took it.
I never saw it again.
I swear on my life.
I believe you.
Avada Kedavra!
I thought it had stopped.
You can't keep letting
him in, Harry.
You-Know-Who has
found Gregorovitch.
The wandmaker?
He wants something that
Gregorovitch used to have...
...but I don't know what.
But he wants it desperately.
I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.
Don't.
- It comforts him.
- It sets my teeth on edge.
What's he expecting
to hear, good news?
who long expected it, the
fall of the Ministry was shocking.
I think he just hopes he
doesn't hear bad news.
We promise to remain
your eyes and ears-
How long before he can travel?
bringing you news when we
can, from wherever we can.
I'm doing everything I can.
You're not doing enough!
Take it off.
I said, take it off now.
- Better?
- Loads.
We'll take it in turns, okay?
Finch does admit his invention
currently has one short.
And now, other news:
Severus Snape, newly-appointed
headmaster of Hogwarts...
...has decreed that all students
must conform to the latest house rules.
Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the
school under Dumbledore's leadership.
Snape's curriculum is severe,
reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...
...and infractions are dealt with harshly
by the two Death Eaters on staff.
What's that?
What's that smell?
- What you doing?
- It's heavy.
Oh, sorry. Do you
want me to carry it?
- Yeah, thank you.
- Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.
Numpty.
Snatchers.
Good to know your
enchantments work.
He could smell it. My perfume.
I've told you...
...Ron isn't strong
enough to Apparate.
Well, then, we'll go on foot.
And next time, Hermione, as much as
I like your perfume, just don't wear any.
And now for the names of
missing witches and wizards.
These are confirmed.
Thankfully, the list
is short today.
Jason and Alison Denbright.
Oh. Thank you.
Bella, Jake, Charlie,
and Madge Farley.
Joe Laurie.
Eleanor Sarah Gibbs.
Harry and Bronwyn Trigg.
Rob and Ellie Dowson.

Oh, my God.
What?
I'll tell you in a minute.
Maybe you could tell me now.
The sword of Gryffindor,
it's goblin-made.
Brilliant.
No, you don't understand.
Dirt and rust have no
effect on the blade.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger.
Okay.
Harry, you've already destroyed
one Horcrux, right?
Tom Riddle's diary in
the Chamber of Secrets.
With a Basilisk fang. If you
tell me you've got one of those...
- ...in that bloody beaded bag of yours....
- Don't you see?
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed
the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.
Its blade is impregnated
with Basilisk venom.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger.
- Exactly, which is why--
- It can destroy Horcruxes.
That's why Dumbledore
left it to you in his will.
You are brilliant,
Hermione. Truly.
Actually, I'm highly logical, which
allows me to look past extraneous detail...
...and perceive clearly
that which others overlook.
Yeah, there's only
one problem, of course.
The sword was stolen.
Yeah, I'm still here.
But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.
- What's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.
Not according to you, anyway.
Look, if you've got something
to say, don't be shy. Spit it out.
All right, I'll spit it out. But
don't expect me to be grateful...
...because there's another
damn thing we've gotta find.
I thought you knew
what you signed up for.
Yeah. I thought I did too.
Well then, I'm sorry, but
I don't quite understand.
What part of this isn't living
up to your expectations?
Did you think we were
gonna be staying in a hotel?
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Thought you'd be back by Christmas?
I just thought, after all this time...
...we would've achieved something.
I thought you knew what you were doing.
I thought Dumbledore told
you something worthwhile.
- I thought you had a plan.
- I told you everything Dumbledore told me.
In case you haven't noticed,
we found a Horcrux.
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of
it as we are to finding the rest of them.
Ron. Please, take--
Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't be saying this...
...if you hadn't been
wearing it all day.
Want to know why
I listen to that radio?
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's
name, or Fred, or George or Mom.
You think I'm not listening?
You think I don't know how this feels?!
No, you don't
know how it feels!
Your parents are dead.
You have no family.
- Stop. Stop.
- Fine, then go!
Go, then!
Fine.
Ron.
And you?
Are you coming
or you staying?
Fine. I get it.
I saw you two the other night.
Ron, that's-- That's nothing.
Ron--
Ron, where are you going?
Please, come back.
Ron.
Ron!

Hermione.
Hermione? You were right.
Snitches have flesh memories...
...but I didn't catch the first Snitch
with my hand, I almost swallowed it.
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?
I don't know.
I found something as well.
At first I thought it was an eye,
but now I don't think it is.
It isn't a rune, and it isn't
anywhere in Spellman's Syllabary.
Somebody inked it in. It isn't
part of the book. Somebody drew it.
Luna's dad was wearing that
at Bill and Fleur's wedding.
Why would someone draw it
in a children's book?
Look, Hermione,
I've been thinking.
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.
It's where I was born.
It's where my parents died.
That's exactly where he'll expect you
to go because it means something to you.
Yeah, but it means something
to him too, Hermione.
You-Know-Who almost
died there.
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of
place he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?
It's dangerous, Harry.
But even I have to admit, recently
I've been thinking we'll have to go there.
I think it's possible
something else is hidden there.
What?
The sword.
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...
...where better to hide it than the
birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?
Hermione....
Don't ever let me
give you a haircut again.
I still think we should've
used Polyjuice Potion.
No.
This is where I was born.
I'm not returning
as someone else.
Good night. Ha-ha-ha.
Harry, I think
it's Christmas Eve.
Listen.
Do you think they'd be
in there, Hermione?
My mom and dad.
Yeah, I think they would.
"Ignotus Peverell."
Hey, Harry?
Merry Christmas, Hermione.
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Harry, there's someone
watching us. By the church.
I think I know who that is.
I don't like this, Harry.
Hermione, she knew Dumbledore.
She might have the sword.
This is where they died, Hermione.
This is where he murdered them.
You're Bathilda, aren't you?
Here, let me do that.
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?
Harry.
Lumos.
Harry!
Confringo!
Are you feeling better?
You've outdone yourself
this time, Hermione.
The Forest of Dean.
I came here once with
Mom and Dad, years ago.
It's just how I remember it.
The trees, the river, everything.
Like nothing's changed.
Not true, of course.
Everything's changed.
If I brought my parents back here now,
they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.
Not the trees, not the river...
...not even me.
Maybe we should just
stay here, Harry.
Grow old.
You wanted to know who the
boy in the photograph was.
I know.
Gellert Grindelwald.
He's the thief I saw in
Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.
Speaking of which,
where is my wand?
Where's my wand, Hermione?
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow,
I cast a curse and it rebounded.
I'm sorry.
- I tried to mend it, but wands are different.
- It's done.
Leave me yours.
Go inside and get warm.
I'll take the locket as well.
Trust me.
Lumos.
Accio sword.
Diffindo.
- Hermione?
- Are you mental?
It was you?
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.
And you cast the doe
as well, did you?
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.
Right. Yeah. Antlers.
Okay, Ron. Do it.
I can't handle it. That thing affects me
more than it affects you and Hermione.
- All the more reason.
- No. I can't.
Then why are you here?
Why did you come back?
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for
it to open. When it does, don't hesitate.
I don't know what's in there,
but it'll put up a fight.
The bit of Riddle that was in
that diary tried to kill me.
All right.
One...
...two...
...three.
I have seen your heart,
and it is mine.
I have seen your dreams,
Ronald Weasley...
...and I have seen
your fears.
Least loved by your mother,
who craved a daughter.
Least loved by the girl
who prefers your friend.
Ron, kill it!
We were better without you.
Happier without you.
Who could look at you
compared to Harry Potter?
What are you compared
with the Chosen One?
Ron, it's lying!
Your mother confessed she
would have preferred me as a son.
What woman would take you?
You are nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing compared to him.
Just think...
...only three to go.
Hermione?
Hermione?
Is everything all right?
It's fine. Actually, you know,
it's more than fine.
Hey.
You complete ass,
Ronald Weasley!
You show up here after weeks,
and you say "hey"?
- Where's my wand? Where's my wand?
- I don't know.
- Harry Potter, give me my wand.
- I don't have it.
- How come he's got your wand?
- Never mind why he's got my wand.
What is that?
You destroyed it.
And how is it that you just happen
to have the sword of Gryffindor?
It's a long story.
- Don't think this changes anything.
- Oh, of course not.
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux.
Why would that change anything?
Look, I wanted to come
back as soon as I left.
- I just didn't know how to find you.
- Yeah, how did you find us?
With this. It doesn't
just turn off lights.
I don't know how it works, but Christmas
morning I was sleeping in this little pub...
...keeping away from
some Snatchers...
...and I heard it.
It?
A voice...
...your voice, Hermione...
...coming out of it.
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.
Just my name.
Like a whisper.
So I took it, clicked it, and
this tiny ball of light appeared.
And I knew.
And sure enough, it floated
toward me, the ball of light...
...went right to my chest,
straight through me. Right here.
And I knew it was gonna take me
where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...
...and came to this hillside.
It was dark. I had no
idea where I was.
I just hoped that one of
you would show yourself.
And you did.
I've always liked these
flames Hermione makes.
How long do you reckon
she'll stay mad at me?
Well, just keep talking about that
little ball of light touching your heart...
...and she'll come round.
It was true. Every word.
This is gonna sound crazy...
...but I think that's why Dumbledore
left it to me, the Deluminator.
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it
to find my way back, and she'd lead me.
Bloody hell, I just realized,
you need a wand, don't you?
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.
Nothing special,
but I reckon it'll do.
Took if off a Snatcher
a couple of weeks ago.
Don't tell Hermione this,
but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.
This one was definitely
part troll, the smell of him.
Engorgio.
Reducio!
What's going on in there?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
We need to talk.
Yeah, all right.
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
- Sorry?
See this?
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to
Grindelwald. Look at the signature.
It's the mark again.
It keeps cropping up.
In Beedle the Bard, in the
graveyard in Godric's Hollow.
It was there too.
- Where?
- Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.
But what does it mean?
Look, you've got no idea where the
next Horcrux is, and neither do I...
...but this, this means something.
- I'm sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.
We ought to see Lovegood.
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?
You're not still mad
at him, are you?
I'm always mad at him.
Luna.
Luna.
"Keep off the dirigible plums."
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry
Potter. We met a few months ago.
Could we come in?
- Where is Luna?
- Luna?
She'll be along.
So how can I help
you, Mr. Potter?
Well, actually....
It was about something you were wearing
round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
You mean this?
Yes.
That exactly.
What we've wondered
is, what is it?
What is it?
Well, it's the sign of the
Deathly Hallows, of course.
- The what?
- The what?
The Deathly Hallows.
I assume you're all familiar with
"The Tale of the Three Brothers."
- Yes.
- No.
I have it in here.
"There were once
three brothers...
...who were traveling along a
lonely, winding road at twilight."
Midnight. Mom always
said "midnight."
But "twilight's" fine.
Better, actually.
Do you want to read it?
No. It's fine.
"There were once
three brothers...
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight.
In time, the brothers reached
a river too treacherous to pass.
But being learned in
the magical arts...
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.
Before they could cross, however...
...they found their path
blocked by a hooded figure.
It was Death,
and he felt cheated.
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.
But Death was cunning.
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...
...and asked for the power to
recall loved ones from the grave.
So Death plucked a stone from
the river and offered it to him.
Finally, Death turned
to the third brother.
A humble man...
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...
...without being followed by Death.
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...
...where, with the
Elder Wand in hand...
...he killed a wizard with
whom he had once quarreled.
Drunk with the power that
the Elder Wand had given him...
...he bragged of his invincibility.
But that night, another
wizard stole the wand...
...and slit the brother's
throat for good measure.
And so Death took the
first brother for his own.
The second brother
journeyed to his home...
...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...
...appeared before him.
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.
Driven mad with
hopeless longing...
...the second brother killed
himself so as to join her.
And so Death took
the second brother.
As for the third brother...
...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.
Only when he attained a great
age did the youngest brother...
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility
and give it to his son.
He then greeted Death as an
old friend and went with him gladly...
...departing this life as equals."
So there you are.
Those are the Deathly Hallows.
I'm sorry, sir. I still
don't quite understand.
Where's that pen I had?
The Elder Wand.
The most powerful
wand ever made.
The Resurrection Stone.
The Cloak of Invisibility.
Together, they make
the Deathly Hallows.
Together, they make
one master of Death.
That mark was on a grave
in Godric's Hollow.
Uh, Mr. Lovegood,
does the Peverell Family...
...have anything to do
with the Deathly Hallows?
Uh-- Uh--
Ignotus-- Excuse me. --and his
brothers, Cadmus and Antioch...
...are thought to be the original
owners of the Hallows...
...and therefore the inspiration
for the story. Uh-- Uh--
But your tea's gone cold.
I'll be right back.
Let's go down here.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not drinking any more
of that stuff, hot or cold.
Thank you, sir.
- You forgot the water.
- Water?
For the tea.
Did--? Did I?
How silly of me.
It's no matter. We really
should be going anyway.
No, you can't!
Sir?
You're my only hope.
They were angry, you see,
about what I'd been writing.
So they took her.
They took my Luna.
My Luna.
But it's really you they want.
Who took her, sir?
Voldemort.
Stop! I've got him!
That treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?
They kidnapped her
because he supported me.
He was just desperate.
I'll do the enchantments.
Hello, beautiful.
Well, don't hang
about, snatch them.
Harry.
Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.
Grindelwald. Grindelwald.
Grindelwald.
Hello, Tom. I knew you
would come one day...
...but surely you must know
I no longer have what you seek.
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Tell me who possesses it.
The Elder Wand lies
with him, of course...
...buried in the earth.
Dumbledore.
The Hallows exist...
...but he's only after one of them,
the last one. He knows where it is.
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.
You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.
- Don't touch her. Unh!
- Leave him.
Your boyfriend will
get worse than that...
Get off me.
...if he doesn't learn
to behave himself.
What happened to you, ugly?
No, not you.
- What's your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
Check it.
And you, my lovely...
...what do they call you?
Penelope Clearwater,
half-blood.
There's no Vernon
Dudley on here.
Did you hear that, ugly?
The list says you're lying.
How come you don't want
us to know who you are?
The list's wrong.
I told you who I am.
Change of plan.
We're not taking this
lot to the Ministry.
Get Draco.
Well?
- I can't be sure.
- Draco. Look closely, son.
If we are the ones to hand
Potter over to the Dark Lord...
...everything would be forgiven.
All would be as it was, you understand?
Now, we won't be forgetting who
actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.
You dare to talk to me like
that in my own house?
Lucius.
Don't be shy, sweetie.
Come over.
Now, if this isn't who we think it is,
Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all.
We need to be absolutely sure.
What's wrong with his face?
Yes, what is wrong with his face?
He came to us like that.
Something he picked up
in the forest, I reckon.
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Was it you, dearie?
Give me her wand. We'll see
what her last spell was.
Ah. Got you.
What is that?
Where'd you get that from?
It was in her bag when we
searched her. Reckon it's mine now.
Are you mad?
Go! Get out!
Cissy, put the boys
in the cellar.
I want to have a little conversation
with this one, girl-to-girl.
What are we gonna do? We can't
leave Hermione alone with her.
Ron?
Harry?
Luna?
That sword is meant to be in my vault
at Gringotts. How did you get it?
What else did you and your
friends take from my vault?!
I didn't take anything. Please.
I didn't take anything.
I don't believe it.
We have to do something.
There's no way out of here.
We've tried everything. It's enchanted.
- Please! please!
- Shut up!
You're bleeding, Harry.
That's a curious thing
to keep in your sock.
Help us.
- Let her go.
- Shut up. Get back.
You, goblin, come with me.
- Aah!
- Dobby?
What are you doing here?
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.
Dobby will always be
there for Harry Potter.
You can Apparate in and out of this
room? Could you take us with you?
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.
Works for me.
Dobby, I want you to take
Luna and Mr. Ollivander--
Shell Cottage on the
outskirts of Tinworth.
Trust me.
Whenever you're ready, sir.
Sir? I like her very much.
Meet me at the top of
the stairs in 10 seconds.
Ow.
Who gets his wand?
I'm only going to ask you
once more, goblin.
Think very, very carefully
before you answer.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?
Who got into my vault?
Who stole it?
Who stole it? Well?
When I was last in your
vault, the sword was there.
Oh, well then, perhaps it
just walked out on its own then.
There is no place
safer than Gringotts.
Liar!
Consider yourself
lucky, goblin.
The same won't be
said for this one.
Like hell.
Expellliarmus!
Stupefy.
Stop!
Drop your wands.
I said, drop them!
Pick them up, Draco, now.
Well, well, well,
look what we have here.
It's Harry Potter.
He's all bright and shiny and new
again, just in time for the Dark Lord.
Call him.
Call him.
Stupefy!
Stupid elf.
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.
Dobby only meant to
maim or seriously injure.
How dare you take
a witch's wand?
How dare you
defy your masters?
Dobby has no master.
Dobby is a free elf.
And Dobby has come to save
Harry Potter and his friends.
Hermione.
You're all right. We're safe.
We're all safe.
Harry Potter.
Dobby.
Dobby. No, just-- Hold on.
Hold on. Look,
just hold on, okay?
We'll fix you.
Hermione will have something.
In your bag. Hermione?
Hermione?
What is it? Help me.
Such a beautiful place...
...to be with friends.
Dobby is happy to
be with his friend...
...Harry Potter.
We should close his eyes.
Don't you think?
There.
Now he could be sleeping.
I want to bury him.
Properly. Without magic.
